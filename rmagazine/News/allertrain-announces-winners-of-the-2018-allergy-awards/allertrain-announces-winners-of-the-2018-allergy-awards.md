&ldquo;I am both honored and humbled by this special recognition from AllerTrain&trade; for the effort that our entire team puts into safe management of food allergies! We have worked diligently over the years to establish a strong program that puts our students and their health first, and developing strong relationships with students and their families as they move onto campus is a big part of that. Everything we do to keep our guests safe, from careful allergen labeling, to gluten-free and allergen-free stations in several eateries, to our 100% gluten-free dining room, has evolved from that commitment to individualized care.&rdquo; Said Michele Lefebvre, Director, Nutrition Management at Cornell Dining.

&ldquo;We at AllerTrain&trade; feel it&rsquo;s important to honor those at the forefront of the industry, passionate about food allergy safety especially when it comes to managing food allergies and taking care of diners individual needs. Through these allergy awards we not only get to honor these individuals, restaurants and colleges/universities but also to acknowledge them for their hard efforts. Congratulations to the winners of the 2018 awards, we are grateful for your hard work in the food allergy world as are the millions of diners who feel safer dining out of their homes in all food service areas!&rdquo; said Betsy Craig, CEO of AllerTrain&trade; by MenuTrinfo&rdquo;
