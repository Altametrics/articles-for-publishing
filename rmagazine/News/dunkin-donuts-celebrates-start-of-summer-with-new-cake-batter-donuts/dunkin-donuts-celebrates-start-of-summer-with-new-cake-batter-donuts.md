Summer is almost here with us and Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts, it seems, is more than ready to celebrate its arrival. To begin with, the American coffee and baked goods brand &nbsp;will ring in one of its favorite days of the year &mdash; National Donut Day on Friday, June 1st &mdash; by once again&nbsp;offering guests a free classic donut of their choice&nbsp;(while supplies last) with the purchase of any beverage. The offer is good all day on June 1st at participating Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts restaurants nationwide on classic donut favorites including Boston Kreme, Glazed, Glazed Chocolate and Strawberry Frosted with Sprinkles.

<!--more-->Next, Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts is welcoming summer by cooking up not one but two new specialty donut varieties that truly take the cake. The new&nbsp;Chocolate Cake Batter Donut&nbsp;is filled with chocolate-flavored cake batter filling, frosted with chocolate icing and topped with colorful confetti sprinkles, while the new&nbsp;Vanilla Cake Batter Donut&nbsp;features vanilla-flavored cake batter filling, frosted with white icing and topped with confetti sprinkles. Both are available at participating Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts restaurants nationwide for a limited time beginning Monday, May 28. Select Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts restaurants will also brighten donut fans&rsquo; days with the&nbsp;Sweet Summertime Donut, a specialty donut featuring a sunshine design with blue icing, yellow icing drizzle and a Glazed Old Fashioned MUNCHKINS&reg; donut hole treat placed in the center.
