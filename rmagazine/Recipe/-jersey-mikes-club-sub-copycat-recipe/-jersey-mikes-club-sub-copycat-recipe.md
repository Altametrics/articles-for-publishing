How did you start your morning? Perhaps you had a sandwich for breakfast? Or maybe you popped into Jersey Mike&rsquo;s for lunch? If you answered yes to any of these questions, it is obvious that you are a sub lover.

<!--more-->If so, do you know that you are among the 50% of Americans who eat at least one sub per day?&nbsp; Let me share another amazing fact about subs and Americans - it is estimated that 300 million sandwiches are consumed every single day in America alone.

Another fact &ndash; the most expensive sandwich ever prepared was a grilled toast sandwich. It was prepared in 2004 and sold for a whopping $ 28,000 because it appeared to hold an image of Mary mother of Jesus!

National sandwich day happens to be celebrated on 3rd November every year, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t surprise your family and friend with home-cooked subs any day.

I guarantee you that with the following recipe, anyone who takes a bite will not be forgetting your sandwiches any time soon!
