One sure way to attract customers is to offer menu items that can&rsquo;t be found elsewhere. For too long, fast food fans have had to use flavorless plastic utensils to enjoy milkshakes. Well no more, as starting today,&nbsp;Del Taco Restaurants, Inc.&nbsp;(NASDAQ: TACO) is taking shake consumption to a whole new level with its newest dessert item, the Churro Dipper Shake. Now available nationwide on Del Taco&rsquo;s new Late Night Bites Menu,** the Churro Dipper Shake features a warm, crispy cinnamon churro dipped in a creamy Vanilla shake with chocolate swirls.

<!--more-->&ldquo;For as long as I can remember, we&rsquo;ve been forced to choose between a straw and a spoon to enjoy our favorite shakes,&rdquo; said Barry Westrum, Del Taco&rsquo;s Chief Marketing Officer. &ldquo;Inspired by our fans&rsquo; passion for deliciously Instagrammable content, we wanted to go all in with a fun and craveable late-night offering, perfect for the warm summer nights ahead.&rdquo;

The Churro Dipper Shake is just one of Del Taco&rsquo;s three delicious menu offerings on the company&rsquo;s new Late Night Bites Menu sure to entice the night owls, whether they are picking up a graveyard shift or leaving an after-party. The full late night menu includes:

&ldquo;At Del Taco, we&rsquo;ve discovered that the churro is more than just a delicious cinnamon and sugar-doused pastry,&rdquo; Westrum added. &ldquo;Its ridges are the perfect tool for collecting and savoring the leftover chocolate sauce and ice cream that the straw couldn&rsquo;t quite get.&rdquo;

While the Late Night Bites Menu was inspired by fans who crave Del Taco outside the traditional breakfast, lunch and dinner hours, the three menu items are available all day and night.
