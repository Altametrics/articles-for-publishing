ingredients:
  - ingredient_name: 1 10-ounce package     frozen strawberries in syrup
  - ingredient_name: 1 3/4 cups     water
  - ingredient_name: 1 3-ounce package      strawberry Jell-O
  - ingredient_name: 1 cup     heavy cream
  - ingredient_name: 5 large     eggs, separated
  - ingredient_name: 1 1/2 cups     granulated sugar
  - ingredient_name: 1/2 cup     cold water
  - ingredient_name: 2 teaspoons     vanilla extract
  - ingredient_name: 1 1/2 cups     all-purpose flour
  - ingredient_name: 1/2 teaspoon     baking powder

directions:
  - step: Defrost the frozen strawberries and pour the entire package, including the syrup, into a blender or food processor and puree for 10 to 15 seconds until smooth.
  - step: Combine the strawberry puree with 1 1/2 cups of the water in a small saucepan over medium heat.
  - step: When the strawberry mixture comes to a boil, add the entire package of Jell-O, stir to dissolve, and remove the pan from the heat to cool. 
  - step: When the strawberry mixture has cooled to room temperature, divide it in half into two medium bowls.
  - step: Beat the whipping cream until it is thick and forms peaks. Fold the cream into one of the bowls of the strawberry mixture until well combined. This is your strawberry mousse. Cover and chill.
  - step: To the other bowl, and the remaining 1/4 cup of water. This is the strawberry syrup. Cover and chill this mixture as well.
  - step: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
  - step: Beat the egg yolks until they turn creamy and a much lighter shade of yellow.
  - step: Add the sugar and blend it well into the yolks.
  - step: Add the water and vanilla and combine well with the egg yolk mixture.
