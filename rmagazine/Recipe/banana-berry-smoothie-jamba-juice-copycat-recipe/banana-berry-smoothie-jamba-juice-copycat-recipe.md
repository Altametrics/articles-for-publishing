Smoothies can be quickly whipped up for breakfast, a healthy snack, and can even be served for dessert. While delicious, smoothies become even healthier when involving superfoods such as kale or blueberries. No matter what time you plan on drinking a smoothie, our Jamba Juice Banana Berry Smoothie Copycat Recipe is sure to satisfy your fruity cravings.

<!--more-->Before we get started, you're probably wondering if blueberries are worth your time and effort in terms of health benefits. Well, yes, they are! Blueberries have been labeled as a superfood, meaning they have incredible health benefits for the body. Did you know that blueberry leaves can be cooked? That&rsquo;s not all, they can be eaten raw or even brewed to make tea, pretty amazing, don&rsquo;t you think?

Since our smoothie will not be using the leaves, we&rsquo;ll concentrate on the fruit itself, or berry if you'd like. This recipe will also include a couple of other healthy ingredients to make our smoothie more interesting.

This Jamba Juice Banana Berry Smoothie Copycat Recipe is based off one of the biggest smoothie brands in the country. Enjoy!
