A new, large-scale consumer study conducted by Market Force Information (Market Force) reveals America&rsquo;s favorite quick-service restaurant (QSR) chains in five popular food categories: burgers, sandwiches, Mexican, pizza and chicken.

<!--more-->The study found In-N-Out is America&rsquo;s favorite burger chain, Wawa ranked first for sandwiches, Chipotle for Mexican food, Pizza Ranch for pizza and Chick-fil-A for chicken.

&ldquo;In this year&rsquo;s study, we saw that scores on the Composite Loyalty Index for QSR brands across all categories declined from last year,&rdquo; said Brad Christian, chief customer officer at Market Force Information. &ldquo;We attribute this to two factors: consumer expectations of the QSR experience are rising, and, in many cases, execution at these restaurants is declining. As our research continues to show, delighting guests by providing an exceptional customer experience is a key differentiator in an incredibly competitive environment.&rdquo;

**Burgers: In-N-Out Burger is Favorite, McDonald&rsquo;s Lands at Bottom**

In-N-Out fans are known for their fierce loyalty and &ndash; in many cases &ndash; their pleas for this regional burger chain to bring a location to their town. The California-based chain ranked No. 1 among burger chains in Market Force&rsquo;s 2018 QSR study for the second consecutive year, followed by Culver&rsquo;s in second place and Five Guys in third.

In-N-Out also received the highest scores across all QSR food categories studied, making it America&rsquo;s favorite QSR across the board. On the flip side, Burger King, Jack in the Box and McDonald&rsquo;s ranked lowest among the 13 burger chains studied. 

**In-N-Out Dominates All Customer Experience Categories**

In-N-Out was not only the favorite QSR burger brand overall, but it also took the top spot in all eight customer experience categories, including value, food quality, service speed, staff friendliness, cleanliness, atmosphere, healthy options and curb appeal. Five Guys and Culver&rsquo;s also consistently performed well, with Five Guys ranking second for food, speed of service and cleanliness, and Culver&rsquo;s ranking second for atmosphere, friendliness and curb appeal. Results were based on the study participants&rsquo; most recent visit to a given restaurant.

**Sandwiches: Wawa Advances Four Spots to Unseat Firehouse Subs&nbsp;&nbsp;**

Wawa is a 54-year-old chain with more than 790 convenience retail stores on the East Coast. It offers fresh food selections such as custom-prepared hoagies, freshly brewed coffee, hot breakfast sandwiches, specialty beverages and an assortment of soups and sides. Wawa rose four places to unseat the 2017 sandwich category winner, Firehouse Subs, which slipped 15 percentage points to land in second place this year.

Additionally, 28% used a kiosk and 27% used a tablet to place their order

**Methodology**

For the rankings, Market Force asked participants to rate their satisfaction with their most recent QSR experience, and their likelihood to refer that restaurant to others. The results were averaged to attain a Composite Loyalty Index score. Only chains that received at least 100 votes and representing 2% or more of votes were analyzed.

**Demographics**

The survey was conducted online in February 2018 across the United States. The pool of 11,487 respondents represented a cross-section of the four U.S. census regions. Fifty percent reported household incomes of more than $50,000 a year. Respondents&rsquo; ages ranged from 18 to over 65. Approximately 73% were women and 26% were men.

Nearly 11,500 consumers were polled for the study, which also reveals consumers&rsquo; QSR dining habits, brand preferences and in-restaurant technology use.
