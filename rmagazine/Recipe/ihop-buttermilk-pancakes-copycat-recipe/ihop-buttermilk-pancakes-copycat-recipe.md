Truth be told, breakfast would be incomplete without pancakes in most American households. That does, however, not imply that pancakes are exclusively an American &ldquo;thing.&rdquo;

<!--more-->You&rsquo;ll be surprised to discover that this well-loved breakfast food is enjoyed in almost all corners of the world. In fact, in some communities, pancakes are not a breakfast delicacy as is usually the case in America. To some people, pancakes are a must-have lunch/dinner accompaniment.

Now, if you love pancakes and you live somewhere in the U.S., there is no way you haven&rsquo;t tasted, or at least heard about, IHOP pancakes, formerly International House of Pancakes.

Their pancakes are everywhere, but there is one particular variety that seems to have won the hearts of most, if not all, pancake lovers out there &ndash; their buttermilk pancakes.

These pancakes are super fluffy, and they taste superb! They are also extremely easy to make! After trying out this recipe, I promise you are never stepping into any IHOP location in the near future.
