Americans love ice cream! In fact, the United States is among the top 3 countries with the highest ice cream consumption worldwide.

<!--more-->Baskin-Robbins, the world&rsquo;s largest chain of ice cream specialty shops, is shaking things up at locations nationwide with the launch of its new Sundae Shakes. Available now,&nbsp;Sundae Shakes&nbsp;combine the best of two classic ice cream treats, a milkshake and a sundae, into one delicious frozen treat. Sundae Shakes feature a milkshake base and are topped with an ice cream scoop with all the toppings of a classic sundae, including whipped cream, chopped nuts and a cherry. Sundae Shakes are customizable with any milkshake and ice cream flavor combination.

Baskin-Robbins is also honoring moms this Mother&rsquo;s Day with the launch of its new&nbsp;Floral Stripe Cake. Featuring stripes of different shades of pink and an elegant rosette design, the Floral Stripe Cake is available in a 6&Prime; round, 9&Prime; round and Mini Tiered Cake option, and can be customized with mom&rsquo;s favorite cake and ice cream flavors, including the returning May Flavor of the Month,&nbsp;Mom&rsquo;s Makin&rsquo; Cookies&trade;. This flavor is inspired by all of the best ingredients from Mom&rsquo;s homemade cookies, including brown sugar-flavored ice cream filled with chocolate chip cookie pieces, chocolate-flavored chips and a cookie dough batter-flavored swirl. The Floral Stripe Cake is available for pre-order both in-store and online at&nbsp;
