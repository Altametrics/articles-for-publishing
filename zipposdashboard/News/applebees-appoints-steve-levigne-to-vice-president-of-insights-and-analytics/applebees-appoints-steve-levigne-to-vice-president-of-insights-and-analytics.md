<!--more-->Earlier this week, Applebee&rsquo;s announced the appointment of Steve Levigne as their new vice president of insights and analytics. Levigne joins the American Food Company after a highly successive 2-decade career at McDonalds where he served until recently as vice president of strategy and insights for all their restaurants in the United States.

His role as vice president of strategy and insights at McDonalds held him accountable for strategic planning, business analytics, industry tracking, and guest satisfaction among other related responsibilities. He holds a master's degree from the Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.

In his new role at Applebee&rsquo;s, he is expected to ensure the brand remains guest-focused across all brand initiatives seeing that he now represents the eyes, ears, and heartbeat of Applebee&rsquo;s. Together with his team, Levigne will uncover all possible insights and utilize highly advanced analytics to best position the food company for sustained growth and enhanced relevance.

He is excited to join Applebee&rsquo;s and looks forward to contributing to the Company&rsquo;s success.

"I'm excited to join such an iconic brand and best-in-class team," said the new vice president. "I look forward to uncovering real insights and contributing to innovative marketing strategies that continue the momentum for Applebee's."

Applebee&rsquo;s seems happy and excited to have him on board too according to John Cywinski, Applebee&rsquo;s president.

"Steve is a highly-regarded veteran of the restaurant industry and understands our challenges from a culinary, service, value and brand differentiation perspective. Most importantly, franchisee partnership is part of his DNA.&nbsp; He will be a terrific culture fit for the Applebee's team," said Cywinski.

Levigne will be reporting directly to Cywinski, who promised to partner with their new vice president of insights and analytics across all strategic initiatives.
