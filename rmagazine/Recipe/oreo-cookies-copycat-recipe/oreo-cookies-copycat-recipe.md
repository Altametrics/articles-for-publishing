ingredients:
  - ingredient_name: 2 Cups      Powdered Sugar
  - ingredient_name: 1 Cup      Chocolate Cocoa Powder
  - ingredient_name: 2 Cups     Flour
  - ingredient_name: 1/2 Teaspoon     Salt
  - ingredient_name: 1 1/4 Cups     Butter, room temperature
  - ingredient_name: 1 Teaspoon     Vanilla
  - ingredient_name:      For The Filling;
  - ingredient_name: 1/2 Cup     Butter, melted then cooled
  - ingredient_name: 1 Tablespoon     Vanilla
  - ingredient_name: 1/2 Cup     Water
  - ingredient_name: 4 Cups     Powdered Sugar

directions:
  - step: First, cream the butter and sugar together for the dough for around 2 minutes or it’s light a fluffy. 
  - step: Next, mix in the vanilla, cocoa powder, and salt until well combined. Now add half of the flour and combine. 
  - step: You want a dough that is dry and crumbles a little, so add the rest of the flour in but only ¼ cup at a time and stop when the dough reaches the desired consistency.
  - step: Form the dough into three balls, make each ball into a disk, wrap them in plastic and refrigerate for 15 minutes.
  - step: Roll out the dough between two pieces of parchment paper until it’s about ¼ to 1/8 of an inch thick. Using a 2-inch round cookie cutter, cut out as many cookies as you can.
  - step: Bake for 8-9 minutes and watch closely. The cookies are black already so be careful not to burn them.
  - step: Let the cookies cool while you prepare the frosting. Again cream the butter and sugar together but add in the vanilla as well. 
  - step: Mix in 1 teaspoon of water at a time until you have a dough that is the consistency of play dough.
  - step: Divide it in half and roll it into a log/cylinder shape about 2 inches thick (you will be cutting them into disks for the cookies).
  - step: Chill until cookies have cooled. Then slice off ¼ to ½ inch of cream to put in between the cookies then repeat until all your cookies are filled
