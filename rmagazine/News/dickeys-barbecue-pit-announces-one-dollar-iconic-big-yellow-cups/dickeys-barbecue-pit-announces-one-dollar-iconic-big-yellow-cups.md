Serving the tastiest food in the locality doesn&rsquo;t always equate to a full restaurant every single night. Sometimes, restaurants need to run a promotion every now and then to attract new customers and to retain regulars.

<!--more-->That is exactly what Dickey&rsquo;s Barbeque Pit is doing beginning April 30 and continuing throughout May. During this duration, Dickey&rsquo;s will offer dine-in guests $1 Big Yellow Cups.

&ldquo;At Dickey&rsquo;s, our focus is and always will be the quality of our authentic, Texas-style barbecue,&rdquo; says Trevor Wilson, Vice President of Marketing at Dickey&rsquo;s Barbecue Pit. &ldquo;In honor of National Barbecue Month in May, we wanted to have our guests celebrate by enjoying our delicious barbecue with Dickey&rsquo;s iconic Big Yellow Cup for only $1.&rdquo;

In the month of May, Dickey&rsquo;s will host a contest through Instagram where barbecue lovers can enter to win Free Barbecue for a Year. To enter the contest, guests will have to follow Dickey&rsquo;s Barbecue Pit on Instagram, tag their friends in the original post announcing the contest and post a photo of what they do with their Dickey&rsquo;s Big Yellow Cup using the hashtag &ldquo;ShowUsYourCup&rdquo;.
