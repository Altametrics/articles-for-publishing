As part of their &ldquo;Cleaner Blending Initiative, Orleans-area-based&nbsp;smoothie&nbsp;franchise company, Smoothie King, has announced the addition of whole organic spinach to their menu. According to Mitchell Grittman, Smoothie King&rsquo;s food scientist, new smoothie blends which feature organic spinach are already available for customers to try out.

Organic spinach joins a broad range of whole ingredients in Smoothie King&rsquo;s Cleaner Blending Menu, such as carrots and kale.

&ldquo;Our new spinach smoothies are packed with fiber, potassium, vitamin A and vitamin C, making them nutritious additions to our Cleaner Blending menu,&rdquo; said Grittman. &ldquo;Not only will these smoothies help guests fill the &lsquo;whole&rsquo; in their diets, they also stay true to our promise to create better-for-you blends with quality ingredients.&rdquo;

Smoothie King&rsquo;s Cleaner Blending initiative focuses on removing added sugar, artificial flavors, colors and preservatives, added hormones in dairy, and GMO fruits and veggies from its smoothie offerings while including more whole fruits and vegetables.&nbsp;The company is on track to achieve its Cleaner Blending goals in more than 50 Purpose blends by the end of 2018.
