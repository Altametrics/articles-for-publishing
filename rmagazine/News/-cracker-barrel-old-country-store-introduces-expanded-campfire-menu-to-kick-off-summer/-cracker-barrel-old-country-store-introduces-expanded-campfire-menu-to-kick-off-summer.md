Restaurant menu items are just like fashion &ndash; they come and go. Cracker Barrel Old Country Store&reg; announced the return of the guest-favorite Campfire menu, which this year offers more ways to experience the spirit of Campfire season than ever before.

<!--more-->To kick off summer, the limited-time Campfire menu features bold, Southern flavors and includes new items like Roasted Sweet Glazed Chicken, Smoky Beef Brisket Breakfast, BBQ Pork, and a S&rsquo;mores Latte. The classic Campfire Beef also makes its return this summer, featuring USDA Choice Beef Chuck Roast, sweet corn on the cob, red skin potatoes, fresh carrots, tomato wedges, and onions, all seasoned with Cracker Barrel&rsquo;s signature campfire spice and delivered right to the table tightly wrapped in foil to seal in the juices. It&rsquo;s joined by last summer&rsquo;s breakthrough favorite, the Cracker Barrel Campfire S&rsquo;more dessert.

The expanded menu of Campfire Meals introduces new flavors and food experiences for guests in dishes that recall memories of favorite summer pastimes. Unexpected twists on classic dishes offer bold flavors for guests to enjoy this summer, like the Roasted Sweet Glazed Chicken, which features a Southern Sweet Tea Glaze that celebrates a summertime staple of tables in the South, and comes with Seasoned Corn on the Cob, sprinkled with North Carolina BBQ Spice, parmesan cheese and parsley, and Campfire Baked Beans that feature smoky beans cooked traditionally with tomato, mustard and spices, and topped with chopped bacon.

On the sweeter side of the menu, the Cracker Barrel Campfire S&rsquo;more, Cracker Barrel&rsquo;s twist on the classic camping dessert, will be joined for the first time by the S&rsquo;mores Latte, which blends marshmallow, milk chocolate, and graham cracker flavors with rich espresso and steamed milk, topped with whipped cream, crumbled graham crackers, and HERSHEY&rsquo;S&reg; Milk Chocolate Bar.

The full Campfire menu includes Smoky Beef Brisket Breakfast, Chocolate Chip Pancake Breakfast, S&rsquo;mores Latte, Loaded Hashbrown Casserole, Roasted Sweet Glazed Chicken, Campfire Beef, BBQ Pork, Campfire Baked Beans, Seasoned Corn on the Cob, Strawberry Lemonade, and Cracker Barrel Campfire S&rsquo;more dessert.
