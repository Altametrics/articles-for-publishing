An omelette, sometimes spelt as omelet, can be described as a dish or meal produced from beaten eggs that have been pan-fried with oil or butter. The eggs can either be beaten alone or with a small amount of water, cream, or milk. It is not uncommon for the dish to be folded around vegetables, cheese, meat, mushrooms, and other fillings.
