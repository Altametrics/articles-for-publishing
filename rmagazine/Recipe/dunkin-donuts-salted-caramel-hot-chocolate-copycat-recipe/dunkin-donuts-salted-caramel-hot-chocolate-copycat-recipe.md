If you are looking for a nice afternoon treat for yourself or your family, why not make some hot chocolate if the weather allows it? Before we get to today&rsquo;s recipe, which is all about hot chocolate, let&rsquo;s take a deeper look at this beverage.

<!--more-->Hot chocolate is sometimes referred to as drinking chocolate, cocoa tea, or chocolate tea. This hot beverage is usually prepared out of heated milk or water, or a combination of both, shaved chocolate, and a sweetener.

The shaved chocolate may be replaced with cocoa powder or melted chocolate. The drink usually takes on a thicker consistency when melted chocolate is used. &nbsp;The beverage can be topped with whipped cream for those who prefer it that way.

This recipe is a copycat of one of the leading chocolate brands in America &ndash; Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts. Enjoy!
