Recently, Jersey Mike&rsquo;s Subs announced its intention to raise an estimated $6 million for charity. The campaign culminated on March 28,&nbsp;Day of Giving,&nbsp;when 1,360 Jersey Mike&rsquo;s restaurants donated 100 percent of sales, not just profits, to&nbsp;more than 170 different charities&nbsp;across the nation.

<!--more-->Unsurprisingly, in conjunction with its generous customers, the fast-casual sandwich franchise, did manage to raise the predicted amount which, as promised, will be donated to charities across the nation.

&nbsp;&ldquo;I would like to thank our extraordinary customers, franchise owners, team members and charity partners who helped us raise the most ever during Jersey Mike&rsquo;s 8th&nbsp;Annual Month of Giving in March,&rdquo; said Peter Cancro, Jersey Mike&rsquo;s founder and CEO.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Our mission statement has always been focused on making a difference in people&rsquo;s lives, and the over $6 million raised this March will go a long way toward supporting the good work of our local partner charities.&rdquo;

Cancro, who bought his first sub shop at age 17, credits two local businessmen in Point Pleasant Beach where he grew up &ndash; Jack Baker of Baker&rsquo;s Lobster Shannty and Bob Hoffman of Hoffman&rsquo;s Ice Cream &ndash; with showing him the importance of giving unconditionally to the community. From the beginning this philosophy has been central to Jersey Mike&rsquo;s mission.

During the month of March, customers were invited to come in to their local Jersey Mike&rsquo;s restaurant and make a donation to a local designated charity partner. Then, on&nbsp;Jersey Mike&rsquo;s &ldquo;Day of Giving,&rdquo; 100 percent of the day&rsquo;s sales were donated to each local charity partner.&nbsp;The charity recipients included&nbsp;schools,&nbsp;hospitals, youth organizations, food banks and more.

&ldquo;Giving . . . making a difference in someone&rsquo;s life&rdquo; has been the mission of Jersey Mike&rsquo;s from the beginning. Since 2010, Jersey Mike&rsquo;s locations throughout the country have raised more than $28 million for worthy local charities and have distributed more than 2 million free sub sandwiches to help numerous causes.
