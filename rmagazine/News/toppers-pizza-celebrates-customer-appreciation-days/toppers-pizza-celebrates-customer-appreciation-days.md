A client appreciation plan can make your clients to fall in love with your business and is, therefore, a critical component to expanding your client base.

<!--more-->Toppers Pizza is proud to bring the party and has been delivering a quality product for more than 25 years. As a way of thanking the loyal fans who have helped the company succeed and grow in their communities, the company is offering half off all pizzas for the last eight days of May as part of their Customer Appreciation Days promotion taking place May 24 &ndash; 31.

&ldquo;Our fans truly respect pizza and have helped make Toppers a regular part of their lives. So, this is a chance to show them our appreciation by cutting the price of all of our pizzas in half,&rdquo; said Toppers Pizza Founder and CEO Scott Gittrich. &ldquo;Even though pizzas will be 50 percent off during Customer Appreciation Days, as always, our fans can expect a quality product featuring real, never-frozen 100% Wisconsin mozzarella cheese, hand-cut fresh veggies, and hand-tossed dough made-from-scratch in our locations every day.&rdquo;

Toppers Pizza is committed to proving that better doesn&rsquo;t have to cost more. The company recently introduced a new Pick 2 or More for $5.99 value menu featuring any medium 2-topping pizza, any single order of Topperstix, any &frac12; lb. boneless wings, or any Baked Mac &lsquo;N Cheese. This followed the introduction of a Pick 2 for $9.99 deal featuring any pizzas at any size or any Topperstix at any size.

The Customer Appreciation Days promotion comes on the heels of the Wisconsin-based innovation leader in the pizza space introducing a brand new House Recipe pizza, the Nacho Topper, featuring salsa, jalape&ntilde;os, tortilla chips and nacho cheese. The Nacho Topper will be available for 50 percent off during Customer Appreciation Days. The Nacho Topper was introduced along with a new line of Baked Mac &lsquo;N Cheese options as well as Nachostix, a new addition to the brand&rsquo;s popular line of Topperstix.

&ldquo;We never settle when it comes to providing our fans a quality product at a value and we appreciate that they keep coming back to us and supporting our franchisees who are working to be a positive force in the local community,&rdquo; said Scott Iversen, Vice President of Marketing for Toppers Pizza. &ldquo;Our Customer Appreciation Days promotion is a small way of thanking them for their loyalty but we work hard to gain their business, and will continue to do so, year-round.&rdquo;

Toppers is one of the fastest growing better-pizza chains in the United States now with restaurants in 16 states and with territories available across the country.
