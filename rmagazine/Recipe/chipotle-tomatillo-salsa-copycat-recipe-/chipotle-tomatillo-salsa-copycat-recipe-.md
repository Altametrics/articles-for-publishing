Are tomatillos baby tomatoes? Absolutely not! Yes, their Spanish name converts to &ldquo;little tomato,&rdquo; and they are related to the tomato, but they are not tomatoes.&nbsp;Tomatillos are green, little, round-shaped vegetables/fruits native to Central America. They have an acidic flavor that can light up just about any meal and they carry a whole bunch of health benefits for the body.

<!--more-->To begin with, tomatillos are a great source of vitamin C &ndash; a single serving provides around 21% of the daily recommended intake. Vitamin C supports many bodily functions including the repair of the skin, blood vessels, and other organs.&nbsp;Tomatillos are also a good source of fiber and niacin. Niacin is important as it supports metabolism. They are also very low in caloric content, as one cup of tomatillos is only roughly 42 calories. If you are looking for something that will satisfy your hunger pangs without increasing your daily calorie intake, you may consider adding tomatillos to your meals occasionally.

However, adding tomatillos to your diet can be a bit difficult even though they are highly versatile. The following Chipotle Tomatillo Salsa Copycat Recipe is an easy and delicious way to include tomatillos into your diet.
