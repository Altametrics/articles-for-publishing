Do you know that the world&rsquo;s largest pizza was made on October 11, 1987? It is said that the pizza weighed in at an astonishing 44, 457 pounds and consisted of 2,387 pounds of pepperoni, 9,375 pounds of cheese, 6,445 pounds of sauce, 1,103 pounds of water, and 18,174 pounds of flour among other items.

<!--more-->Loius Piancone and Lorenzo Amato were the two men behind this remarkable job. The giant pie was sliced into 94, 248 pieces and was consumed by more than 30,000 people.

Pretty amazing don&rsquo;t you think? Now, what&rsquo;s even more amazing is that in the 1800s, pizza was actually a peasant meal! This, however, changed when a margarita pizza was created for visiting loyalty. The king and queen were both so impressed that the meal became an instant hit and was soon a staple in all restaurants.

Today, it is estimated that approximately 350 slices of pizza are consumed every second in America.

If you have always wanted to create your own pizza but didn&rsquo;t know where to start, here is a copycat recipe from one of the leading pizza houses in the United States.
