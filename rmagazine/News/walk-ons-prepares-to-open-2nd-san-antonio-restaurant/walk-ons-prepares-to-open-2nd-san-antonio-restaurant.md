On Monday, April 2, one of the most looked-forward-to-restaurants in Huebner Oaks Centre, Walk On&rsquo;s Bistreaux &amp; Bar, will be opening its doors to the community. Huebner Oaks Center and its surroundings can expect to savor the restaurant&rsquo;s renowned fresh Louisiana cuisine from as early as 11 a.m. come April 2.

<!--more-->Patrons have been encouraged to arrive early as the restaurant will be offering their first 25 clients a mini football autographed by Drew Brees, New Orleans Saints superstar, who also happens to be Walk-On&rsquo;s Co-Owner.

The New Orleans Saints superstar and Brittany, his wife, became Walk-On&rsquo;s Co-Owners in May 2015.

Located at 11075 IH 10 W., the new restaurant aims at providing a lot of fun and entertainment for the whole family. To celebrate their entrance into the Huebner Oaks community, the restaurant will hold a VIP night pre-opening event on Saturday, March 31.

During the pre-opening, Walk-On&rsquo;s will donate $5,000 to Teed Off at Cancer.

Teed Off at Cancer is a renowned charity in San Antonio. The pre-opening is an invitation-only event and is expected to start at 6:30 p.m.

&ldquo;We are quickly expanding across Texas thanks to extraordinary franchisee partners like Haidar,&rdquo; explained President and COO of Walk-On&rsquo;s Enterprises, Scott Taylor.

&ldquo;This new restaurant is extremely beautiful, and we know it&rsquo;s going to be a very welcome addition to the dining and entertainment landscape in the Huebner Oaks Center."

According to the Brees, the New Orleans Saints superstar, Walk-On&rsquo;s offers a great atmosphere for everyone, including family, business colleagues, and teammates. That, apparently, is one of the reasons behind the restaurant&rsquo;s expansion efforts.

Walk-On&rsquo;s presently has 18 locations with more expected to come up soon in Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Texas.

Once open, the Huebner Oaks Walk-On&rsquo;s will be the second Walk-On&rsquo;s in San Antonio. The new location is expected to operate from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. from Monday through Thursday.

On Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, it will remain open from 11.a.m to midnight.
