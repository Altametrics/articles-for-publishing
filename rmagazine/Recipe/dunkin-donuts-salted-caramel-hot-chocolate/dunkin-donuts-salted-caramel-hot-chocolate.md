Chocolate is one of the most craved foods in the world, there&rsquo;s no doubt about that!

<!--more-->Unfortunately, chocolate comes packed with tons of calories in the form of sugar and fat, which may not sound great to you if you are a chocolate devotee. The good news, however, is that, with a little creativity here and there, you can satisfy your chocolate cravings without having to constantly worry about your waistline.

Let me introduce cocoa powder. I&rsquo;m sure you are already acquainted with cocoa as a beverage but are you aware that it is the same substance used to make chocolate?

One tablespoon of this powder carries around 10 calories. That means you may just be able to indulge your chocolate yearnings more often if you are creative enough.

The following&nbsp;Dunkin Donuts Salted Caramel Hot Chocolate Copycat Recipe is easy to&nbsp;make, and I promise you, it tastes just like chocolate! Enjoy!
