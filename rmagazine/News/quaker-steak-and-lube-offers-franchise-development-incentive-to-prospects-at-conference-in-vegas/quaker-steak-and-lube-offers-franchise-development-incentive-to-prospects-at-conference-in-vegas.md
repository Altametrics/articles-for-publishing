Quaker Steak &amp; Lube, the casual dining restaurant chain, has announced their participation at the upcoming annual Multi-Unit Franchising Conference as an exhibitor. This year&rsquo;s event will be held in Las Vegas and is expected to start on 3rd April and last through 6th April.

As part of their continuing efforts aimed at attaining nationwide growth, the award-winning brand recently unveiled a new franchise-development incentive to attract new franchisees in key target markets across the country.

&nbsp;

All qualified candidates who will sign up to open two or more restaurants will receive a special offer which shall entail a waiver on development fees and 50% off the regular franchise fee. They will also receive discounted loyalty fees as part of the special offer from the franchisor.

&nbsp;

To qualify for the offer, potential franchisees must have a net worth of not less than $3 million, and at least $1 million in liquid assets. They must also have multi-unit operating experience, most preferably in the restaurant sector.

&nbsp;

During the Las Vegas event, the company&rsquo;s key executives will be available to meet and interact with prospective candidates at booth number 529. These executives include the company&rsquo;s director of operations support, Paul Weston, and vice president of operations and franchise services, Bruce Lane.

&nbsp;

&ldquo;We continue to invest in our processes, products, and infrastructure to refresh our brand while at the same time staying true to our unique identity which has continued to attract a cult-like following across the nation,&rdquo; said Lane. &ldquo;Our efforts have positioned Quaker Steak &amp; Lube for tremendous growth. We look forward to presenting the new and improved Quaker Steak &amp; Lube to conference attendees.&rdquo;

&nbsp;

The brand is still in their revitalization process and recently introduced the Express walk-up concept specially designed to cater for quick-service audiences. This ultramodern new restaurant prototype features a completely new look. It also offers a familiar, but somewhat condensed menu. The first Quaker Steak &amp; Lube Express location became operational in January and is located in Gary, Indiana.

&nbsp;

The Express concept is just one of the brand&rsquo;s continued revitalization strategies. Other strategies they plan to apply in future include enhanced online ordering and breakfast options.

&nbsp;

&ldquo;Our new Express concept has allowed us to charm both quick and full-service audiences. It has also reinforced Quaker Steak &amp; Lube as an excellent option for multi-unit operators who may be looking to diversify their portfolio with a well-established brand,&rdquo; added Lane, the brand&rsquo;s vice president of operations and franchise services. &ldquo;Our traditional concept can now exist even in non-traditional spaces, while at the same time providing our loyal customers with the same exceptional service they are accustomed to and great tasting food too. We are very excited for Quaker Steak &amp; Lube Express&rsquo; growth potential.&rdquo;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The brand is looking to expand to markets across the entire nation.
