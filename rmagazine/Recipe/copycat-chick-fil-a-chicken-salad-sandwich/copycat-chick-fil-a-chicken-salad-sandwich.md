Recently, Chick-Fil-A announced it was axing a sandwich that many Americans can admit to having been obsessed with &ndash; the chicken salad sandwich. I don&rsquo;t know about the others, but I was personally very distressed at this announcement. This was my favorite fast food choice for a long time reason being that it was the only healthy fast food I knew that was actually tasty.

<!--more-->Yes, you read that right! Chick-Fil-A&rsquo;s chicken salad was actually healthy. It was not only highly nutritious, but it was also quite low in calories &ndash; perfect sandwich for anyone trying to maintain or bring down his/her weight.

But not to worry, Chick-Fil-A might have discontinued their chicken salad, but who said you can&rsquo;t make your own chicken salad that tastes exactly like Chick-Fil-A&rsquo;s? As long as you have a food processor, all you need is 10 minutes to assemble the sandwich! Good luck!&nbsp;&nbsp;
