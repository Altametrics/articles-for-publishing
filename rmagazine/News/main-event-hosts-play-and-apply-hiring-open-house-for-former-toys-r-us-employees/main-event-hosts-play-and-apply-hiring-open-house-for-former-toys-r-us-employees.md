Working in the restaurant industry not only provides tremendous career advancement, but it also offers unlimited networking opportunities.

<!--more-->Main Event Entertainment&nbsp;is hosting a fun Play &amp; Apply hiring event from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., May 14-18. Former Toys R Us and Babies R Us team members are invited to visit centres around the country to apply and interview for a position at Main Event.

Consistently ranked the &ldquo;Best Place for Parties,&rdquo; thanks to its distinctive &ldquo;Eat. Bowl. Play.&rdquo; Experience, Main Event specializes in taking days from ordinary to extraordinary. To show candidates just how fun joining the team would be, applicants will each receive a FUNcard once they have completed the interview.

&ldquo;Main Event&rsquo;s vision and talent strategies align with that of Toys R Us &ndash; to create uniquely fun experiences for our guests by exceeding expectations, embracing teamwork and having fun,&rdquo; said Rhonda Merchant, Director of Talent Acquisition at Main Event Entertainment. &ldquo;With the recent closures of Toys R Us and Babies R Us, we saw an opportunity to turn a challenging situation into something positive for the retail brand&rsquo;s talented employees.&rdquo;

Centres around the country have opportunities for customer-facing and back of house team members, operations managers, sales managers, technicians, servers and party hosts. Are you a good fit for one of these positions? RSVP for the Open House at&nbsp;

&ldquo;Main Event team members are expected to give their best on the job, so we do our part in making sure you stay motivated, feel valued and live your best life,&rdquo; said Merchant. &ldquo;We offer competitive pay, a tuition reimbursement program, career development paths, comprehensive benefits and fun perks. We&rsquo;re growing and look forward to having some hardworking individuals join the Main Event family to create serious fun for our guests.&rdquo;

Each centre features state-of-the-art bowling, multi-level laser tag, billiards and a games gallery featuring more than 100 of the latest interactive video games. And whether you&rsquo;re looking for a chef-inspired casual dining experience &ndash; with delicious shareables like wings, loaded nachos or oven-baked artisan pizza in a full-service American-fare grill &ndash; or handcrafted cocktails in a high-energy bar surrounded by big screen TVs, Main Event&rsquo;s culinary and bartender teams aim to please.

Main Event Entertainment is growing rapidly with 40 centres across the United States serving more than 20 million guests annually.&nbsp;
