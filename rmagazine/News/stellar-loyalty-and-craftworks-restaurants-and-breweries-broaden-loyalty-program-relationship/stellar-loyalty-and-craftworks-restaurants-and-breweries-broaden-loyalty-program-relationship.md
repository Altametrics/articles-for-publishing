Customer loyalty and engagement programs are the real drivers of customer loyalty.

<!--more-->Stellar Loyalty, the cloud-based loyalty and engagement software company that helps organizations quickly deliver differentiated loyalty experiences, and CraftWorks Restaurants &amp; Breweries, Inc., the nation&rsquo;s leading operator and franchisor of brewery and craft beer-focused casual dining restaurants, announced today they are broadening their relationship to develop loyalty and engagement programs for CraftWorks&rsquo; entire portfolio of restaurant and brewery brands.

Following the successful implementation of Old Chicago Pizza &amp; Taproom&rsquo;s one-of-a-kind OC Rewards loyalty program, Stellar Loyalty is working with CraftWorks to develop custom loyalty and engagement programs for Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant, Rock Bottom Restaurant &amp; Brewery, and all of CraftWorks&rsquo; Specialty Brands.

&ldquo;We were drawn to Stellar Loyalty because of its modern applications, open architecture, and proven track record of quickly rolling out and supporting sophisticated, differentiated loyalty programs with complex rules,&rdquo; said Jaime Vasquez, VP of Marketing and Group Sales for CraftWorks Restaurant &amp; Breweries. &ldquo;After successfully scaling Stellar Loyalty to more than 100 locations and witnessing how the platform helped us quickly customize our program and meet the unique needs of our two million plus guests at Old Chicago, we feel confident that Stellar Loyalty is the right partner to help us develop and implement equally as innovative rewards programs for our entire portfolio of brewery restaurant brands.&rdquo;

Stellar Loyalty and CraftWorks are co-presenting at the 2018&nbsp;

&ldquo;CraftWorks is exactly the type of partner Stellar Loyalty strives to work with &ndash; an organization that prides itself on standing out from the pack with its creativity, innovation, and commitment to its customers,&rdquo; said Jon Siegal, Stellar Loyalty VP and GM. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t be more excited to be expanding our relationship with CraftWorks and helping its brands create truly innovative loyalty and engagement programs that will delight their customers, increase engagement, build loyalty, and in turn, increase sales.&rdquo;
