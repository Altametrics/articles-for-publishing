America loves pancakes! This breakfast staple can be described as a flat thin cake, often round, and made from a starch-based batter containing milk, eggs, butter, and other ingredients.

<!--more-->According to the history of pancakes, the oldest pancake recipe ever written dates back to the 15h century and it appeared in an old English cookbook. William Shakespeare is believed to have been an ardent pancake lover since he appears to have mentioned them in most of his plays.

The pancake recipe has not changed much since the 15th century save for a slight deviation dating back to 1737 which contained ingredients like 18 egg yolks, wine, and cream.

Today&rsquo;s recipe is about Denny&rsquo;s &ndash; one of the most favoured pancake brands in America. If you are lucky enough to have all ingredients at hand, all you need are 20 minutes of your time to produce some of the sweetest and crispiest pancakes you&rsquo;ve ever seen. Good luck!
