<p>Surprisingly, one of the most common problems of restaurants is its menu. Whether it&rsquo;s the design or the number of pages the menu has, it&rsquo;s certain that menus can be a tricky game to play.</p><!--more-->
<p>Even Chef Gordon Ramsay criticizes the appearance of restaurant menus when they&rsquo;re just too long and complicated!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more common to hear tips on how to decorate your restaurant than design your menu, which is why some owners think theirs are completely fine so long as they present their dishes. But hiring professional designers and/or writers to do the job for you add only to the cost &ndash; sometimes it&rsquo;s best that you do things yourself, right?</p>
<p>So, what does it take to create a beautiful menu that your customers will understand and remember?</p><br>

<br><h2>1. Check your competition</h2>
<p>Before designing your menu, check out what you&rsquo;re up against, especially when they&rsquo;re in your vicinity. It helps you determine the common factors in the menus&rsquo; appearances and prices, and knowing these helps you visualize how yours will be different.</p>
<p>Your menu doesn&rsquo;t have to be completely different from everyone else&rsquo;s to stand out &ndash; as Lidia Bastianich says, &ldquo;Classics works for a reason&rdquo;. There will always be similar elements like font faces and the order of listing, but yours must stand out with something that adds to these common elements. And knowing how your competition does their thing avoids accidentally-similar styles, too!</p><br>
