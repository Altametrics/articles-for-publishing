ingredients:
  - ingredient_name: 5     Large russet potatoes
  - ingredient_name: 1/4 teaspoon     Freshly ground black pepper
  - ingredient_name: 1/4 teaspoon     Sea salt
  - ingredient_name: 3     Garlic cloves, coarsely chopped
  - ingredient_name: 1 cup     Water
  - ingredient_name: 1/2 cup     Olive oil
  - ingredient_name: 1/4 cup     Lemon juice

directions:
  - step: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.
  - step: Scrub the potatoes well, but don’t peel them. Cut them lengthwise into quarters. If potatoes are extremely large, cut each potato into eight wedges. 
  - step: Place the potatoes in a 9 x 13-inch baking pan. Season them with salt and pepper. Add garlic.
  - step: Mix the marinade by combining the water, olive oil, and lemon juice. Pour the marinade over the potatoes. Be sure to cover all of the potatoes.
  - step: Roast the potatoes for about 40 minutes, then remove the pan from the oven. Turn the potato wedges so all sides can brown. Do this by flipping the “white” top side of the potato onto the bottom of the dish. 
  - step: Place the potatoes back in the oven and roast for an additional 20 to 30 minutes.
  - step: When you remove the potatoes they will be nice and golden brown all over, and will have absorbed the marinade.
