Summer is finally and what better way to beat the heat than with a frappe. A frappe, pronounced as frap-pay, can be described as an iced drink or beverage that has been shaken and blended to produce a tasty and foamy substance. It is often served with whipped milk and various toppings. 

<!--more-->The frappe goes back to the 19th century, but the instant coffee version, which is the most popular version today, dates back to 1957, and is believed to have been accidentally invented by an employee who could not find hot water to make his coffee and instead chose to use cold water and ice cubes.

Though the beverage is traditionally a coffee, it is still possible to make chocolate, tea, and juice frappes; the possibilities are practically endless. Today&rsquo;s recipe is a copycat of Starbucks Coconut Mocha Frappe Cappuccino &ndash; a wonderfully cool beverage that you can make easily without having to spend much. Good luck!
