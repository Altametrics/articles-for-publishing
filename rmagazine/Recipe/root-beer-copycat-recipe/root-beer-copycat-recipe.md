 <p>Did you know A &amp; W created the original Root Beer concoction?</p><!--more-->
<p>When America was no longer able to drink REAL legal beer in 1919 during prohibition, Roy Allen and Frank Wright came up with a solution for thirsty patriots to wet their pallets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This sweet, foamy beer-like drink combined root, herbs, and berries and helped Roy and Frank mark their fortunes.</p>
<p>As Prohibition ended in 1933, they had 171 stands emblazoned with the A&amp;W logo all across the country. These roadside stands preluded what we now know as fast food drive-thrus. And, you can find A&amp;W root beer at one of these drive-thrus across North America.</p>
<p>If you want to save the time and copy their famous recipe at home, we&rsquo;ve copied it for you. Follow the steps we&rsquo;ve provided below, and you&rsquo;ll be sipping on your classic Root Beer in no time.</p>
