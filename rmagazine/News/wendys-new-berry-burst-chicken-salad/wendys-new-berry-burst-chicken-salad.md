Every summer, many restaurants come up with new flavors and different food combinations in a bid to capture the vibes of the season. This summer, Wendy&rsquo;s hasn&rsquo;t disappointed, and neither has the Berry Burst Chicken Salad, their newest salad sensation. 

<!--more-->Not only is it packed with fresh berry flavors, tangy feta cheese, crisp leafy greens, a sweet raspberry vinaigrette and warm, freshly grilled chicken &ndash; but it&rsquo;s also delivered for FREE, right to your doorstep*.

That&rsquo;s right, Wendy&rsquo;s is making it easier than ever to grab something fresh and still tackle all those summertime to-dos. Wendy&rsquo;s provides a solution for busy people everywhere with a balanced and leafy green salad, and now with DoorDash, Wendy&rsquo;s national exclusive logistics partner, customers can enjoy free delivery with promotion code (BERRYBURST). The Berry Burst Chicken Salad is topped with almonds and antioxidant-rich seasonal berries. The full-size salad serves 4 grams of fiber and 41 grams of protein to keep you full and energized. Add in the fact that the full-sized salad, including two packets of dressing, is under 500 calories, while still serving &frac12; cup of fruit, &frac12; cup of dairy, plus a complete days&rsquo; worth of vegetables, and you&rsquo;ve got a salad that gets almost&nbsp;as much done as you do!

&ldquo;Our new Berry Burst Chicken Salad is filled with freshly grilled chicken, fresh strawberries and blueberries, and hand-chopped lettuce &ndash; those are things you just don&rsquo;t find at other salad places,&rdquo; said Kurt Kane, Wendy&rsquo;s chief concept and marketing officer. &ldquo;And now that we&rsquo;re offering free delivery through DoorDash, it&rsquo;s easier than ever to get a great tasting and fresh salad no matter how busy you might be this summer.&rdquo;

At Wendy&rsquo;s, every salad is prepared fresh and in-restaurant each and every day. Built on a bed of hand-chopped lettuce and made with hand-cut strawberries, juicy blueberries, crumbly feta cheese and toasted almonds, the Berry Burst Chicken Salad hits on sweet, savory, salty and crunchy. Raspberry Vinaigrette Simply Dressed&reg; by Marzetti adds a smooth sweet taste to the already flavorful salad. And to top it all off, add a warm, freshly grilled all-white meat chicken breast and you&rsquo;ve got a deliciously different salad you won&rsquo;t find anywhere else.
