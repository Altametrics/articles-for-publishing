A chicken salad can be described as any salad which contains chicken as its main ingredient. This kind of salad may also contain other ingredients in smaller quantities such as mayonnaise, pickles, celery, pepper, hard-boiled eggs, and more.

<!--more-->Chicken salad is a great favorite among many Americans, mostly because it's among the few healthy options available in many fast food restaurants or joints. All the same, finding a restaurant that serves a tasty chicken salad can be a bit difficult as I have realized. One brand that never disappoints though is Chicken Salad Chick.

The brand was established in 2007 when a woman by the name Stacy Brown opened a small business to support her family. Today, what started as a simple family business has grown into a well-loved chain eatery thanks to their unique variety of freshly-made chicken salads.

Perhaps one of the most popular salad from Chicken Salad Chick is the grape salad, mostly because it blends well with most sandwiches. I hope you enjoy making this salad as much as I do.
