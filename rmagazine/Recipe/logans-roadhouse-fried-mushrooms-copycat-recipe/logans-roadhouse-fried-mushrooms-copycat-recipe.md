ingredients:
  - ingredient_name: 3 Cups     Vegetable oil for frying
  - ingredient_name: 1 Pound      Fresh white button mushrooms
  - ingredient_name: 1 Cup     All-purpose flour
  - ingredient_name: 2 Teaspoons     Salt
  - ingredient_name: 1 1/2 Teaspoons     Ground black pepper
  - ingredient_name: 1 Cup     Buttermilk
  - ingredient_name: 1/2 Cup     Water

directions:
  - step: Pour oil into a large saucepan or deep fryer to a depth of 3 to 4 inches. Heat the oil to 350 degrees.
  - step: Gently clean the mushrooms with a damp paper towel. If these stems are very large (greater than 3/4 inch), trim off the stem, as they may be woody. If the mushrooms are small, there is no need to trim off the stem.
  - step: Combine the flour with the salt and pepper in a bowl. Stir to combine the flour mixture. Combine buttermilk and water in another bowl.
  - step: Dredge the mushrooms in the seasoned flour, shaking off the excess, and then dip them in the buttermilk. Dredge them in the flour again. Knock off the excess flour.
  - step: Lower the mushrooms gently into the hot oil, cook them until they are golden brown. It will take about 2 to 3 minutes for the mushrooms to cook. Drain on a wire rack.
  - step: Serve with your favorite sauce.

One thing I love about Logans Roadhouse is their fried mushrooms. True, the restaurant offers many great dishes, appetizers, and drinks, but there&rsquo;s something about their buttermilk-dipped mushrooms that I simply can&rsquo;t resist.

<!--more-->Today&rsquo;s recipe is very simple, and I&rsquo;m more than convinced you will be happy with the results. Just like Logans Roadhouse, we will use a seasoned flour and dip them in buttermilk but first, let&rsquo;s look at a few nutritional facts about mushrooms.

Mushrooms are technically not vegetables but a type of fungi that happens to be one of the healthiest foods you will ever come across. They practically have no fat content and are very low in sodium and calories. If you are particularly careful about your weight, mushrooms may be a perfect substitute for meat in your meals. Believe me; they will be just as satisfying if not more satisfying.
