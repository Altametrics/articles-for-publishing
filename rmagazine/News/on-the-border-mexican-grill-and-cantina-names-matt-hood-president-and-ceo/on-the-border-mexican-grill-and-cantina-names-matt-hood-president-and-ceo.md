"I am very excited about the future&nbsp;of On The Border," said&nbsp;Hood. "This is a world-class brand with a unique position in the casual dining industry thanks to its vibrant experience, its attractive off-premise offering and a strong licensing presence.&nbsp; I look forward to working with the team to help this brand reach its enormous potential."&nbsp;

Hood&nbsp;is a graduate of Kellogg Graduate School at&nbsp;Northwestern University, where he holds a Master's Degree in Business Administration. He also holds a Bachelor's Degree in Advertising &amp; Public Relations from&nbsp;Texas Christian University.
