Unlike what many people believe, red meat, when consumed in moderation, can be beneficial to our bodies. To begin with, meat is a great source of protein.

<!--more-->Protein has time and time again been referred to as a building block of life. This is because our bodies require this macronutrient to maintain almost all of the necessary processes for keeping us healthy. Even a very small amount of red meat contains a very impressive amount of proteins.

Meat is also an excellent source of amino acids. There are 9 amino acids that the body cannot produce by itself and red meat contains all of these 9 amino acids. That&rsquo;s not all, you will find many other nutrients and minerals that contribute to our general well-being in meat. These nutrients include B-complex vitamins, zinc, iron, and selenium.

The following Outback Steakhouse Steak Copycat Recipe will allow you to obtain all the benefits of red meat while enjoying a deliciously seasoned steak from the comforts of your home!
