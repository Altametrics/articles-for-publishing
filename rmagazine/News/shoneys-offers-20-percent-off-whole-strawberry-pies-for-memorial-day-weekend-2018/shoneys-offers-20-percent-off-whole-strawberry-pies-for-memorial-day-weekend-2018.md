Memorial Day is a day that has been set aside to solemnly honour those who have died serving our country in the army.

<!--more-->Shoney&rsquo;s, the All-American iconic restaurant brand, will have a special offer for families during one of the first picnic get-together opportunities of the year on Memorial Day Weekend 2018 (Friday, May 25 &ndash; Monday, May 28) by offering a 20% discount on America&rsquo;s favorite dessert,&nbsp;Shoney&rsquo;ssignature Whole Strawberry Pies To-Go.

&ldquo;Shoney&rsquo;s&nbsp;has been an integral part of American families for more than 70 years and we want our famous dessert to be a part of your Memorial Day gatherings as we unite to remember those who gave all in order to make America the greatest country on earth,&rdquo; said&nbsp;Shoney&rsquo;s&nbsp;Chairman and CEO Mr. David Davoudpour.

Shoney&rsquo;s&nbsp;Whole Strawberry Pies are made-in-house, from scratch with delicious, fresh strawberries in a flaky crust mixed with&nbsp;Shoney&rsquo;s&nbsp;special glaze and finished with whipped topping. &nbsp;Earlier this year,&nbsp;Shoney&rsquo;s&nbsp;gave away slices of this American treat to all moms on Mother&rsquo;s Day.&nbsp;Shoney&rsquo;s&nbsp;serves more than a million slices of its famous Strawberry Pie each year.

Always known for having best-in-class value,&nbsp;Shoney&rsquo;s&nbsp;was voted one of the best 8 family dining restaurants in the United States in the&nbsp;2016 Consumer Picks Survey via Nation&rsquo;s Restaurant News, placing #6 overall. In the survey,&nbsp;Shoney&rsquo;s&nbsp;was recognized for having the best rating for value among all family dining chains and also scored well for its service, menu variety and diners being likely to recommend it. The distinction has been the vision of&nbsp;Shoney&rsquo;s&nbsp;Chairman and CEO Mr. David Davoudpour.

Since acquiring the great American eatery in 2007, Mr. Davoudpour has been on a driven and spirited mission to reinvigorate and revitalize&nbsp;Shoney&rsquo;s, a family-friendly, southern-style restaurant brand.&nbsp;Shoney&rsquo;s&nbsp;is one of the first, and has always been one of the most popular, family casual dining concepts in the United States.

In order to get back to what Mr. Davoudpour confidently calls&nbsp;Shoney&rsquo;s&nbsp;&ldquo;Glory Days,&rdquo; the brand is&nbsp;now growing through franchising&nbsp;following an extensive revitalization effort.&nbsp;Shoney&rsquo;s&nbsp;is offering franchising opportunities to qualified single and multi-unit candidates.

Shoney&rsquo;s&nbsp;currently operates in 17 states and is&nbsp;now growing through franchising&nbsp;following an extensive revitalization effort.&nbsp;
