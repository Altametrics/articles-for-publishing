Growing an enterprise into a successful brand can be a tough call &ndash; it requires perseverance, critical thinking, and of course, the right leadership.&nbsp;Considering this, Fazoli's achieved a lot of growth with new openings and successful market relaunches.

<!--more-->To date, the company has successfully opened over seven new restaurants, with plans to open up to an additional five locations by the end of the year &ndash; setting the brand up to achieve its highest number of openings in nearly 10 years. This continued surge in development has also helped the brand successfully reenter three markets where it previously operated, since the beginning of the year, including Columbus, GA, Plant City, FL, and Poplar Bluff, MO.

&ldquo;Coming off of a record-breaking first quarter, both our executive team and franchisees alike have kept the momentum going,&rdquo; said Carl Howard, president and chief executive officer of Fazoli&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Thanks to our brand revamp which has helped us to better understand guests&rsquo; tastes and preferences by offering fresh, high-quality food at a great value, we have been able to successfully launch a remodel initiative, in addition to capitalizing on tremendous grand openings since the beginning of the year.&rdquo;

Fazoli&rsquo;s has successfully returned to three markets after several years, including Columbus, Plant City, and Poplar Bluff, by offering freshly prepared Italian fare at a reasonable cost and reestablishing itself as a leader in the elevated quick service Italian space. Strong brand loyalty and customer appeal have resulted in exceptional and sustained sales performance in each of these newly reopened markets.

In addition to reestablishing a presence in these key cities, Fazoli&rsquo;s achieved its two highest grand opening weeks in company history with its openings in Hazard, KY, and Columbus, GA, surpassing $100,000 and $95,000 in grand opening sales, respectively.

Furthermore, Fazoli&rsquo;s has continued its remodel initiative after successfully revamping nine of its locations in 2017 and observing sustained success in each of those restaurants. Through updating to a contemporary look and feel, including a modern interior design and updated premium menu offerings, the brand has been able to attract both new customers and appeal to its large base of brand loyalists.

Fazoli&rsquo;s is America&rsquo;s largest Italian elevated QSR chain, serving freshly prepared pasta entrees, Submarinos&reg; sandwiches, salads, and pizza.
