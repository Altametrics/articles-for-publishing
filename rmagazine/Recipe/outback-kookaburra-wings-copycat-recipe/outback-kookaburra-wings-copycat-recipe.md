Chicken wings are among the most popular snack foods and appetizers not only in the United States but almost every corner of the globe. Americans like them fried, roasted, or baked in a thick barbeque sauce.

<!--more-->When fried, chicken wings tend to be a bit greasy but take on a decidedly pleasant taste. Due to their greasy nature, fried chicken wings have been directly linked to obesity. This does not, however, imply that you should cease to enjoy the delicacy if you are a fan. The trick lies in choosing healthier frying oil options such as olive, canola, and coconut oil. 

Additionally, taking the skin off before frying your wings will significantly reduce the number of calories you consume with each serving. A small chicken wing with its skin on carries about 81 calories while a skinless one comes with only 34 calories. So you see, there is absolutely nothing wrong with enjoying fried chicken wings every once in a while even if you are trying to lose some pounds.

Here is a recipe from one of the most recognized wings brand in the nation &ndash; Outback Steakhouse. Enjoy!
