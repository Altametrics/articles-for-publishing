		ingredients:
  - ingredient_name: 1/4 cup     butter
  - ingredient_name: 3 medium     white onions, sliced
  - ingredient_name: 3 14-ounce cans     beef broth
  - ingredient_name: 1 teaspoon     salt
  - ingredient_name: 1/4 teaspoon     garlic powder
  - ingredient_name: 3 tablespoons     Kraft grated Parmesan cheese
  - ingredient_name: 6 to 12 slices     French bread
  - ingredient_name: 6 slices     Swiss cheese
  - ingredient_name: 6 slices     mozzarella cheese
  - ingredient_name: 6 tablespoons     shredded Parmesan cheese

directions:
  - step: Saute the onions in melted butter in a large soup pot or saucepan for 15 to 20 minutes or until the onions begin to brown and turn transparent.
  - step: Add the beef broth, salt and garlic powder to onions. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer uncovered for 1 hour. Add the grated Parmesan cheese in the last 10 minutes of cooking the soup.
  - step: When the soup is done, preheat oven to 350 degrees F and toast the French bread slices for about 10 to 12 minutes or until they begin to brown. When the bread is done, set the oven to broil.
  - step: Build each serving of soup by spooning about 1 cup of soup into an oven-safe bowl. Float a toasted slice or two of bread on top of the soup, then add a slice of Swiss cheese on top of that. Place a slice of mozzarella on next and sprinkle 1 tablespoon of shredded Parmesan cheese over the top of the other cheeses.
  - step: Place the soup bowl on a baking sheet and broil for 5 to 6 minutes or until the cheese begins to brown.

<p>The French-themed Mimi's Cafe first opened in Anaheim, California in 1978. &nbsp;One of their better-known favorites is the French Market Onion Soup.</p>
<p>One of the best tips for nailing your soup is not to rush it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;It takes time to get that incredible onion taste to encompass your broth.</p>
<p>That time is what transforms this soup into a masterpiece. &nbsp;Each mouthful should be the perfect blend of melted cheese, broth, tender onions, and bread (those perfectly moist croutons).</p>
<p>The best part of Mimi's French Onion Soup is that it comes with a blend of 3 different kinds of cheese!</p>
<p>You're 90 minutes away from food heaven. Check out the steps below and get cooking.</p>
