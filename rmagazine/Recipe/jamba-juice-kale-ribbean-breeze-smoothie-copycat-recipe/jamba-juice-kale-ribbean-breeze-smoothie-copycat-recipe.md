Are you a health enthusiast? If yes, then kale is one food that you simply cannot afford to ignore. True, it has a bitter flavour that most people find too strong for their liking, but love it or hate it, kale is one of the healthiest foods you&rsquo;ll ever come across.

<!--more-->Kale is loaded with a wide range of nutrients, all coming with their own health benefits. To begin with, this green vegetable is loaded with iron. Iron contributes widely to the production of red blood cells.

Kale is also rich in vitamin K, a vitamin that is not talked about too often but is still essential as it helps blood to coagulate during bleeding. The vegetable is also believed to boost heart health and to fight inflammation among many other health benefits.

Taking a glass or two of kale juice daily could, therefore, be one of the best things you could ever do for your health. Below is an amazing kale juice recipe from Jamba Juicers. Enjoy!
