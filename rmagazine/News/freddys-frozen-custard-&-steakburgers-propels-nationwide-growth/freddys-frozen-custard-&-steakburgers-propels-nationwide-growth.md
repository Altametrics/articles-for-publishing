Progression continues to heat up for Freddy&rsquo;s Frozen Custard &amp; Steakburgers, one of the Nation&rsquo;s fastest growing fast-casual restaurant chains. The Wichita based restaurant has reported tremendous growth having opened 17 new restaurants in the first quarter of 2018.

<!--more-->Currently boasting of 300 locations nationwide, Freddy&rsquo;s opened its first franchise in December 2004. By March this year, they were already on their 300th location. The restaurant chain plans to open at least 40 new locations across the U.S. by the end of the year.

Franchise opportunities are available in Florida, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New York, and other markets in the U.S. This continued surge in franchise development has helped expand the brand&rsquo;s presence in new and existing markets nationwide.

In addition, Freddy&rsquo;s signed a development and master franchise agreement with Younata Investment Limited to bring the concept to the Middle East, with plans to develop in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman and Qatar. The franchisee group brings more than 25 years of regional business experience within the Gulf Cooperation Council to the American brand and will be opening Freddy&rsquo;s first international location in Dubai later this year.

&ldquo;The growth we&rsquo;re seeing so far in 2018 is unbelievable. It&rsquo;s through leadership of our outstanding franchisees, commitment to quality products and exceptional service that we&rsquo;re able to continue expanding and make Freddy&rsquo;s accessible to more people across the country,&rdquo; said Randy Simon, co-founder and CEO. &ldquo;Beyond our domestic openings this year, we&rsquo;re thrilled to be taking Freddy&rsquo;s internationally with the opening of our Dubai location later this year. We&rsquo;re eager to introduce the brand to the international market, as well as new and existing markets in the U.S., and look forward to continuing this accelerated growth momentum throughout 2018.&rdquo;

Freddy&rsquo;s menu includes Vienna beef&nbsp;hot dogs, steakburgers, and chicken sandwiches. They have been named as one of the top 10 on Franchise Times magazine&rsquo;s Fast &amp; Serious list for 5 years in a row.
