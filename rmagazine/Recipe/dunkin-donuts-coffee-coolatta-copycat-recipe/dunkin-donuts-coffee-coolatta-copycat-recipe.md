If there is a better refreshment in summer than a coffee coolatta, I&rsquo;m yet to come across one (that is if it exists). Unfortunately, Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts discontinued this popular drink sometime last year to make room for new items on its menu.

<!--more-->Now, the day they made this announcement was quite sad for me, and I believe it was even sadder for thousands, if not millions, of iced coffee enthusiast across the nation.

The good news, however, is that making a coffee coolatta is not rocket science. As long as you have all ingredients, all you need is 5 minutes flat to hack the recipe I&rsquo;m about to share below. I promise you it&rsquo;s the easiest thing you&rsquo;ll ever do.

Before we get started, you must understand that the key to this original coffee coolatta recipe is the hazelnut syrup. Without this ingredient, your coolatta won&rsquo;t just taste the same. Hazelnut syrup is available in most grocery stores.
