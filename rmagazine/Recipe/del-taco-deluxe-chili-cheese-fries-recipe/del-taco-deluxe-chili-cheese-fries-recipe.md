Who invented chili cheese fries? The truth is that no one knows the answer to this question for a fact. Why? Because everyone seems to have an idea of who invented this tasty dish.

<!--more-->For example, if you go to Texas and happen to ask this question, you will be assured that chili cheese fries were invented by one Mr. Jenkins. If you are lucky, you may even hear how Mr. Jenkins was having lunch at a local dairy when he mixed a few ingredients and accidentally invented the dish.

Now, that is Texas&rsquo; side of the story, Chicago, New York, and Philadelphia all have their own version of the story, all of which you will get to read soon on this platform. The truth, however, is that all of these states make and serve their chili cheese fries a bit different.

If you enjoy comfort food, or if you are one of the people who enjoy a late night munchie, here is a Chili Cheese Fries recipe from one of the leading Mexican quick-service restaurants, Del Taco. Good luck!
