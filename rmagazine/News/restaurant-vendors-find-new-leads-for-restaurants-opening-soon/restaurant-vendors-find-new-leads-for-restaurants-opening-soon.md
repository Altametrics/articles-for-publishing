**Denver, CO &ndash; Milk Market
**Local restaurant entrepreneur, Frank Bonnano, is taking his vision of multi-unit, multi-concept operations one step further with the opening of this food hall sometime late spring at 1800 Wazzee Street. The open seating will be surrounded by operators offering fried chicken, bao buns, poke, ice cream and pizza.

**Atlanta, GA &ndash; Sugar Factory American Brasserie**
This family-friendly casual concept plans a 2019 opening at 1080 Peachtree Street, NE. The menu offers something for everyone such as pancakes, crepes, salads, pizza and burgers. They are also known for their &ldquo;group-sized&rdquo; foods such as the &ldquo;King Kong&rdquo; for 12 guests with 24 scoops of ice cream and toppings.

**Wichita, KS &ndash; Let&rsquo;m Eat Brats**
The husband and wife food truck team of Austin and Manu English will open their first brick and mortar unit this summer in the shipping container mall at Central and Volutsia.

**Seattle, WA&ndash; Homer
**Chef Logan Cox has left Sitka and Spruce to open his vision of an upscale-casual eatery with a focus on the Beacon Hill neighborhood sometime in July at 3013 Beacon Avenue South. He wants the cuisine to be approachable with $6 to $22 price points featuring Mediterranean-style fermented and grilled foods.

**Newton, MA &ndash; Inna&rsquo;s Kitchen**
Fans of this kosher-style casual eatery will be happy to see its&rsquo; return to 547 Commonwealth Avenue for a slated July opening.

Chef Erling Wu-Bower has formed a new hospitality company with partners Joshua Tilden, Paul Kahan and Donnie Madia (Underscore Hospitality) to open this summer at 151 W. Erie Street in River North. The menu will feature west coast and Mediterranean foods from two wood-fired hearth ovens.
