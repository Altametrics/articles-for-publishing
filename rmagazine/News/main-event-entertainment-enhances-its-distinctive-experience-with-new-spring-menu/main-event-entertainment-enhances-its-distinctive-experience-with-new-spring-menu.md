Main Event Entertainment&nbsp;has launched a new chef-driven menu featuring gourmet burgers, shareable appetizers, signature pizzas, and seasonal cocktails. What seems to excite the brand most about its new menu is the new Angus Beef Steakburger and Signature Burger Sauce that will be featured on all of its specialty burger builds. The new burger is distinctively juicy and flavorful due to the higher marbling levels of the premium angus beef. Guests wanting a healthier spring option, can indulge in the&nbsp;Best Turkey Burger Ever, a grilled turkey burger served with house-made pickled onions and honey mustard sauce.
