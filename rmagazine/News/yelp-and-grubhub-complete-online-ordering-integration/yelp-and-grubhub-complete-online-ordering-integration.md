<s<!--more-->n style="color: #444444\. font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif; background-color: #fefefe;">the leader in connecting people with great local businesses, and the nation's leading online and mobile food ordering company, today announced the successful integration of Grubhub&rsquo;s restaurant network onto the Yelp platform.</span>

The combination of Grubhub's unmatched restaurant network and efficient delivery infrastructure with Yelp's large purchase-oriented audience positions us to generate thousands of new diners and millions of orders for Grubhub restaurant partners. Yelp users will be able to order from far more local restaurants, while taking advantage of Grubhub&rsquo;s overall lowest-cost delivery.

&ldquo;By tapping into Grubhub&rsquo;s restaurant network, Yelp now offers users the ability to order from a larger and better selection of restaurants across the country,&rdquo; said Jeremy Stoppelman, Yelp&rsquo;s co-founder and chief executive officer. &ldquo;Our long-term partnership with Grubhub strengthens Yelp&rsquo;s competitive position in the restaurant category, which brings millions of users to our platform every day.&rdquo;

&ldquo;We&rsquo;re thrilled to complete our integration with Yelp, which enhances the online ordering experience for diners and will drive more orders to our restaurants from Yelp&rsquo;s tens of millions of monthly users,&rdquo; said Matt Maloney, Grubhub&rsquo;s founder and chief executive officer. &ldquo;For the first time, Yelp users can order from Grubhub&rsquo;s huge network of local favorites, some that don&rsquo;t provide their own delivery services, including many of the most popular restaurants in each market.&rdquo;

As Yelp continues to provide more options to users, the company is also carefully engineering new product experiences to make it even easier to find, order and transact with restaurants that offer food delivery and takeout. To accompany the inventory, Yelp released a new mobile Delivery tab, available to iOS and Android users, where consumers can find the very best local food delivery and takeout. Through the Delivery tab, Yelp surfaces useful information &mdash; like which restaurants offer free delivery or which hot spots in your area offer delivery &mdash; to help consumers find the most relevant ordering options available.
