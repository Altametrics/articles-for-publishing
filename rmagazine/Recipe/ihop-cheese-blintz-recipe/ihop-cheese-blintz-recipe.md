ingredients:
  - ingredient_name: 1 1/2 cups     all-purpose flour
  - ingredient_name: 2 cups     milk
  - ingredient_name: 3 tablespoons     butter, melted
  - ingredient_name: 2 tablespoons     granulated sugar
  - ingredient_name: 2     large eggs
  - ingredient_name: 1/2 teaspoon     vanilla extract
  - ingredient_name: 1/2 teaspoon     baking powder
  - ingredient_name: 1/2 teaspoon     salt
  - ingredient_name:      Butter (for pan)
  - ingredient_name: 1 cup     cottage cheese

directions:
  - step: Use an electric mixer to blend together all the crepe ingredients except the butter for the pan in a large bowl. Blend just until smooth. The batter will be very thin.
  - step: Combine the filling ingredients in a medium bowl and mix by hand. Keep the filling nearby.
  - step: Preheat a 10-inch frying pan over medium heat. When the pan is hot, add about 1/2 teaspoon of butter.
  - step: When the butter has melted, pour 1/3 cup of batter into the pan. Swirl the batter so that it evenly coats the bottom of the pan. Cook for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes or until golden brown on one side.
  - step: Use a spatula to lift an edge of the crepe. Grab it with your finger, slip the spatula underneath, and quickly flip it over. Cook for another 1 1/2 minutes or until a bit lighter shade of brown than the first side, the slide it out of the pan. Repeat with the rest of the batter and stack the finished crepes on top of each other to keep them warm.
  - step: Heat the cheese filling in the microwave for 1 to 2 minutes or until it is hot.
  - step: When ready to fill the crepes, place each crepe, dark side down, on a plate. Pour 2 to 3 tablespoons of cheese filling across the center of the crepe. Fold the sides in and turn the entire blintz over (to hide the seam) onto a serving plate. You can use a knife to cut off the rounded ends off the blintzes if you like. Repeat with the remaining blintzes.
  - step: Serve 2 to 3 blintzes on a plate with a dollop of sour cream and 2 dollops of strawberry preserves carefully arranged on the plate next to the blintzes. Sprinkle the blintzes with powdered sugar.

**Menu Description:**&nbsp;"Crepe-style pancakes filled with a blend of cheeses with strawberry preserves and sour cream."

<!--more-->Detroit's mayoral candidate Sharon McPhail and Detroit schools superintendent David Snead often dined in the city's hottest spot for power breakfasts&mdash;the local IHOP. Those morning breakfasts eventually led to the two exchanging vows in front of 1,80. guests in a 1992. wedding ceremony. It was dubbed Detroit's "wedding of the year."&nbsp;

You'll enjoy this simple recipe for crepes, which, when filled with cheese, become delicious blintzes. The restaurant uses a type of cheese that is similar to soft farmer's cheese, but you can make this with cream cheese, or even with yogurt that has been strained to make it thicker. Any way you decide to go, you're in for a treat.
