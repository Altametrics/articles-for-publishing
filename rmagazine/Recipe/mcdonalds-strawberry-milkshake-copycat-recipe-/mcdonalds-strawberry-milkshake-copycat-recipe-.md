Interestingly, when the word &ldquo;milkshake&rdquo; was first coined in 1885, it had absolutely nothing to do with milk. Instead, it was an adult drink boasting of whiskey and eggs.

<!--more-->Now, as the drink slowly evolved into what it is today, electric blenders were yet to be devised. As a result, people used to mix the ingredients, including ice, manually. Eventually, a mixer was invented by one Hamilton Beach, and things got easier. 

The best time to have a milkshake is during summer when the weather tends to get a bit hot. The good thing about this drink is that you don&rsquo;t have to spend much on it.

As long as you own a good blender, all you need are the ingredients and 5 minutes of your time. Here&rsquo;s a very simple recipe from McDonald's. Enjoy!
