Pizza Hut has offered basketball fans one final chance to win a pair of Pie Tops II plus some free pizza as the Madness comes to an end. The NCAA Division Men&rsquo;s Basketball Tournament, informally known as March Madness, is a single-elimination competition held every spring in the U.S. 

<!--more-->The tournament was founded in the year 1939 and was the idea of a University Coach called Harold Olsen. The tournament has since grown to be among the most-looked-forward-to annual sporting events in the U.S. 

The famous American restaurant chain, which is the Official Pizza of the March Madness, recently introduced Pie Tops II, a limited-edition of shoes that fans can use to order pizza. This pair of shoes can also be used to pause the basketball game as the fan interacts with the pizza delivery guy at the door. 

Pie Tops II come with a couple of buttons situated on their tongues. These buttons are precisely what fans use to order pizza or to pause a game. The pizza button is connected to the Pizza Hut app through Bluetooth technology. The app must be available on the user&rsquo;s phone for the Pie Tops II to work.

Apparently, the phone is largely responsible for the ordering process. The shoes are compatible with receivers from Fios, Dish, DirecTV, Spectrum, and others.

During this final leg of the tournament, March Madness fans and other pizza-enthusiast will have an opportunity to bid on a pair of Pie Tops II. The offer includes a whole year of free pizza. As it is, only four pairs of the shoes are available.

The one-year free pizza initiative is in support of The Literacy Project, a program which is meant to inspire a love of reading among students. The bidding opened on March 26 and is expected to end on April 2<sup>nd</sup> at 11:59 p.m. Basketball fans and other interested fans can visit&nbsp;

&ldquo;This year's tournament has once again featured many unforgettable moments and as fans gather together to watch the Final Four, Pizza Hut wanted to offer them one 'final' chance to swoop up a pair of our Pie Tops II," said Zipporah Allen, Chief Marketing Officer at Pizza Hut. "More importantly it was the perfect time to tie the tournament into The Literacy Project and our long-standing commitment to enabling literacy."

For 33 years now, Pizza Hut has nurtured the Pizza Hut BOOK IT program, an initiative dedicated to boosting literacy among students across all walks of life. Until now, the program has positively impacted more than 65 million students countrywide. 

Encouraged by the program&rsquo;s success, Pizza Hut established The Literacy Project in 2016 to help unlock the full potential of the beneficiaries. All proceeds from the ongoing auction will go to The Literacy Project.

Founded in 1958, Pizza Hut is an American restaurant chain and also international franchise.
