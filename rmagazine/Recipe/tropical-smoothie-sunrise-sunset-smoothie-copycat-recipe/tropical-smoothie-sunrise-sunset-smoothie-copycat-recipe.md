A smoothie can be described as a beverage or drink made from blended fruits and raw vegetables. But the ingredients of this kind of beverage do not have to be limited to these two elements. You can include just about anything in your blender including crushed ice, water, fruit juice, honey, sugar, artificial sweeteners, nuts, chocolate, cookies, seeds, herbal products, herbal supplements, and more.

<!--more-->Smoothies are an excellent source of minerals, vitamins, and enzymes. These nutrients are crucial to our well-being. Without them, we would be more susceptible to illnesses and diseases of all kinds.

That means having a smoothie is the most effortless way to get loads of nutrients into your system within a very short time. The healthiness of a smoothie, however, depends on its ingredients. The healthier the components/ingredients, the healthier the smoothie.

Okay, enough preaching &ndash; here is a smoothie recipe from one of the leading smoothie joints in the country &ndash; Tropical Smoothie Caf&eacute;. I love all of their smoothies, but here&rsquo;s one I would love you to try.
