Without farmers, restaurants would cease to exist. That is why Domino&rsquo;s&nbsp;(NYSE: DPZ),&nbsp;the largest pizza company in the world based on global retail sales, has chosen to recognize American farmers through the Domino&rsquo;s $5.99 carryout special.

<!--more-->The offer, which is valid when you carryout large two-topping pizzas today through May 27, will bring the hard work of America&rsquo;s farmers to your table with any one of the 34 million combinations of Domino&rsquo;s pizza you choose.

&ldquo;There is no Domino&rsquo;s without the dairy, tomato, wheat and other farmers across the United States working hard every day to produce the food we serve,&rdquo; said Jenny Fouracre, Domino&rsquo;s spokesperson. &ldquo;According to the USDA, 97 percent of the 2.1 million farms in the United States are family-owned operations and we are proud that so many of those family farms help to make our pizza possible every day of the week.&rdquo;

Domino&rsquo;s loves farmers and wants to support the future of agriculture as well. That&rsquo;s why Domino&rsquo;s is in the second year of a five-year, $1 million commitment to the National FFA Organization (Future Farmers of America). This month, 18 FFA students received college scholarships sponsored by Domino&rsquo;s as they study to pursue a career in agriculture.

Customers looking to bring American farm products to their table can take advantage of the weeklong $5.99 carryout deal by ordering over the phone, in-store, at&nbsp;
[dominos.com](http://dominos.com/), or via Domino&rsquo;s mobile ordering apps. To find the nearest Domino&rsquo;s location, visit&nbsp;
