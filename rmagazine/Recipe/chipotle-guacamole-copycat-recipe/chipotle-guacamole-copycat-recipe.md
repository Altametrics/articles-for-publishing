Anyone who frequents Chipotle knows that guac is extra. Guacamole, or guac, is the creamiest dip you&rsquo;ll probably find in any Mexican restaurant.&nbsp; The avocado-based dip is used as a topping, but it is also eaten with chips and other meals.

<!--more-->So, what goes in guacamole? Guacamole incorporates a broad range of ingredients other than avocados, of course. Some of these ingredients include onions, cilantro, tomatoes, and lime juice.

This creamy topping or dip is not only delicious, but it also happens to be a source of several important nutrients that have been shown to benefit the body. However, it also happens to pack quite a bunch of calories &ndash; up to 400 calories per cup. Therefore, it should be taken in moderation especially for those who are trying to lose or manage their weight.

The following guacamole recipe is a copycat from Chipotle and is guaranteed to add some texture and flavor to just about any meal or snack, without costing extra. Enjoy!
