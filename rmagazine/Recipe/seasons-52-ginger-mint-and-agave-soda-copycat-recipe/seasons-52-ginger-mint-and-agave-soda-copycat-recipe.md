  - ingredient_name: 1 1/4 Teaspoons     Grated fresh ginger 
  - ingredient_name:      
  - ingredient_name: 1/2 Cup     Water

  - ingredient_name:      
  - ingredient_name:      
  - ingredient_name: 5 leaves     Fresh mint leaves

directions:
  - step: Cut, peel, and grate a piece of fresh ginger. 
  - step: Put 1 teaspoon grated ginger in a saucepan or pot with 3 mint leaves that you have "muddled" by mashing or pressing them to release the minty aroma.
  - step: Add the water and agave and simmer the mixture for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  - step: Strain the liquid into a heatproof cup and let it cool to room temperature, either on the counter or in the refrigerator. In the latter case it should be cool enough in about 10-15 minutes.
  - step: During the simmering, the liquid reduces by about half, so you will have 2 ounces left. Pour it into a glass, add a few ice cubes and your sparkling water. Garnish with remaining ginger and mint leaves as you please and enjoy!

Soda can be a very refreshing treat, especially during a hot afternoon. Unfortunately, sodas are not good for your health, as they have no nutritional value. Yet, there&rsquo;s just something about this fizzy soft drink that uplifts the spirit so nicely.&nbsp;

<!--more-->I&rsquo;ll admit it; I&rsquo;m addicted to soda. Thankfully, I make my own soda, which is much healthier and actually cheaper than store-bought soda.

Yes, you read that right, I make my own soda and so can you! The best thing about making soda at home is that you have full control of every single ingredient that goes into its production. Plus it is a very simple process &ndash; with no chemistry or physics lessons required!&nbsp;

All the steps to make your soda are listed, good luck!
