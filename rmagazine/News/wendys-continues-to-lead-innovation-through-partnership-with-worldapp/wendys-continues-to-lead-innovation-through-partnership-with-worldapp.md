In a bid to support its commitment to leading innovation and operational excellence in the quick service restaurant industry, The Wendy&rsquo;s Company, the world's third-largest quick-service hamburger company, has partnered with WorldAPP, provider of 
[Form.com](http://www.form.com/).

<!--more-->Wendy's&reg; will implement a custom version of Form.com, a powerful and flexible mobile&nbsp;
[data collection platform](https://form.com/restaurant-inspection/), to enhance and improve customer experience evaluations in restaurants.

"At Wendy's, we're always looking for new ways to create a better experience for the customer," said&nbsp;Frank Leary, Vice President of Customer Experience at The Wendy's Company. "I believe that starts by providing franchise and company operators with the tools they need to accurately evaluate and coach their restaurant teams to drive operational excellence."

"Not only do we expect this partnership to further streamline internal operations, but we're also excited to leverage the flexibility and value of the Form.com platform to find new and interesting ways to communicate with Wendy's restaurant operators and affect change on a restaurant-by-restaurant basis," said Leary. "From there, we can dig deeper into the data to find even more ways to delight our customers as a system."

The partnership represents WorldAPP's commitment to delivering innovative mobile solutions that meet and exceed the complex needs and expectations of their enterprise customers. According to the WorldAPP CEO, the move represents an important step in their mission to modernize the way restaurants collect, analyze, and act-on operational data.

"We're very excited to announce this partnership with The Wendy's Company," said&nbsp;Oleg Matsko, CEO of WorldAPP. "Wendy's has always shown a commitment to innovation, and we at WorldAPP are proud that Form.com is now helping them lead the way."

WorldAPP implemented the custom Form.com solution using a rapid approach to mobile delivery. Delivered and integrated in just over three months, the solution provides Wendy's with up-to-the-minute operational data in a streamlined workflow.

"The implementation of Form.com as a mobile evaluation platform for a company like Wendy's demonstrates the sheer power and flexibility of our solution," Matsko continued. "It's also a testament to the persistence and dedication of our team of innovators that worked tirelessly with Wendy's to make it happen."

The Wendy's Company will use the mobile evaluation platform to measure and improve&nbsp;

The Company will use this data to promote system-wide operational excellence and continuous improvement.
