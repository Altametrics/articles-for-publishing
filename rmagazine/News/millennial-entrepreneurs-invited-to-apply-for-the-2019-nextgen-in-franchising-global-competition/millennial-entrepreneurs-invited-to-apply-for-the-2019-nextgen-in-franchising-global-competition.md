We established the competition to not only drive the success of the next generation of franchisors, but also to fuel the growth of the overall franchising community. Each year we are blown away by the quality of applications we receive and are extremely excited to learn about the emerging businesses that are ready to take the next step in 2019. &rdquo;

The NextGen in Franchising Global Competition is open to companies that have been operating for 1-5 years, have the potential to scale through franchising, and with founders ages 21-35.* Twenty winners will receive a trip to the IFA&rsquo;s 59th&nbsp;Annual Convention in Las Vegas from Feb. 24-27, 2019; a spot at the NextGen in Franchising Summit, a two-day educational and networking program for next generation entrepreneurs at the IFA Annual Convention; an accelerator program with industry leaders and CEOs; an opportunity to participate in the final round of the NextGen in Franchising Global Competition for a chance to win a monetary investment to help grow their business; and opportunities to network with leading franchisors, franchisees, and suppliers, as well as other young entrepreneurs.
