Sandwiches are among America&rsquo;s most consumed dishes with around 300 million sandwiches being consumed every single day.

<!--more-->Just in time for the first Saturday in May, Bourbon BBQ is back at Arby&rsquo;s. Following a popular limited-time release of Bourbon BBQ Sandwiches last year, the lineup returns with a new&nbsp;

[brisket](https://arbys.com/our-menu/limited-time-offers/bourbon-bbq-brisket)&nbsp;that has been hickory-smoked for 13-hours and USDA-choice&nbsp;
[Angus steak](https://arbys.com/our-menu/limited-time-offers/bourbon-bbq-steak). The proteins are topped with brown sugar bacon, crispy onion strings, natural cheddar cheese and a BBQ sauce made with oak barrel-aged Kentucky bourbon, cider vinegar, tomato paste, brown sugar, yellow mustard and Worcestershire sauce, all served on a star-top bun.

Guests can also order the three featured proteins &ndash; brisket, steak and buttermilk chicken &ndash; plus brown sugar bacon, crispy onion strings, natural cheddar cheese and Bourbon BBQ sauce on a single sandwich called the&nbsp;
[Bourbon BBQ Triple Stack](https://arbys.com/our-menu/brisket/bourbon-bbq-triple-stack). The addition of chicken to the stack puts this massive sandwich in a league occupied by only one other: Arby&rsquo;s famous Meat Mountain.

&ldquo;Bourbon, BBQ and quality meats, what&rsquo;s not to love?&rdquo; said Jim Taylor, Chief Marketing Officer of Arby&rsquo;s. &ldquo;The star of the show is the Bourbon BBQ Brisket. The combination of the savory sliced brisket, melted, creamy cheddar, sweet brown sugar bacon and tangy Bourbon BBQ sauce delivers a flavor explosion that can&rsquo;t be matched in our industry. It&rsquo;s a sandwich you would expect from a sit-down restaurant or mom and pop BBQ joint for $10 or $12, not from a drive-thru for half the cost.&rdquo;

Also back by popular demand at Arby&rsquo;s is the Orange Cream Shake. The creamy, orange-flavored shake is available for a limited time in 12-ounce, 16-ounce, 24-ounce and 32-ounce sizes.

Arby&rsquo;s is the second-largest sandwich restaurant brand in the world with more than 3,400 restaurants in seven countries.
