One of the best ways for a business to stay relevant and interesting is to embrace a seasonal menu.

<!--more-->The&nbsp;Dairy Queen&reg;&nbsp;system has introduced its first-ever Summer&nbsp;Blizzard&reg;&nbsp;Treat Menu which is filled with iconic summer-inspired flavors and new innovations. From picking fresh berries in a field to enjoying a summer blockbuster movie at a drive-in,&nbsp;DQ&nbsp;has a special&nbsp;Blizzard&nbsp;Treat to make every summer moment feel even sweeter.

The Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A and BRK.B) company is offering&nbsp;DQ&nbsp;fans five&nbsp;Blizzard&nbsp;Treat flavors on the new Summer&nbsp;Blizzard&nbsp;Treat Menu including the new Jurassic Chomp with peanut butter&nbsp;Blizzard&nbsp;Treat, in partnership with Universal Pictures&rsquo;&nbsp;Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, which includes the&nbsp;DQ&nbsp;brand&rsquo;s largest mix-in candy ever and has colossal choco dipped peanut butter bites and fudge topping blended with vanilla soft serve; the new Summer Berry Cheesecake&nbsp;Blizzard&nbsp;Treat, a delightful combination of cheesecake pieces, real raspberries, blackberries and blueberries free of artificial colors or sweeteners hand-blended with creamy&nbsp;DQ&nbsp;signature vanilla soft serve; and the new&nbsp;TWIX&reg;&nbsp;Blizzard&nbsp;Treat, a mix of chopped&nbsp;TWIX&nbsp;cookie bar pieces and caramel topping blended with vanilla soft serve. The Summer&nbsp;Blizzard&nbsp;Treat Menu also includes two fan favorites which were brought back by popular demand, the S&rsquo;mores&nbsp;Blizzard&nbsp;Treat, a delectable blend of marshmallow filled chocolates, graham crackers pieces and vanilla soft serve; and the Cotton Candy&nbsp;Blizzard&nbsp;Treat, a deliciously sweet mixture of cotton candy pieces and colorful sprinkles blended with vanilla soft serve. The&nbsp;DQ&nbsp;brand will introduce two Americana-inspired treats each available for a limited time later this summer.

&ldquo;We are really excited about this Summer&nbsp;Blizzard&nbsp;Treat Menu launch,&rdquo; said Maria Hokanson, executive vice president of marketing for American Dairy Queen Corporation (ADQ). &ldquo;Summer is full of sun-filled days, late evenings and unforgettable moments, and that&rsquo;s what&nbsp;DQ&nbsp;is all about. These&nbsp;Blizzard&nbsp;Treat flavors give our fans a season-long ticket to treat themselves to the best summer yet.&rdquo;

As part of the launch of the Summer&nbsp;Blizzard&nbsp;Treat Menu,&nbsp;Dairy Queen&nbsp;is offering a fan experience unlike any other in brand history. The treat industry leader will unveil experiential rooms that bring to life these five Summer&nbsp;Blizzard&nbsp;Menu Treats in Manhattan on Wednesday, May 23 at Big Screen Plaza. The public is welcome from 5 to 7 p.m. Interior designer, author and&nbsp;DQ&nbsp;super-fan Nate Berkus has designed the spaces for the S&rsquo;mores&nbsp;Blizzard&nbsp;Treat room and the Cotton Candy&nbsp;Blizzard&nbsp;Treat Room.

&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a&nbsp;DQ&nbsp;super-fan since I can remember, it was practically religion growing up,&rdquo; said Nate Berkus. &ldquo;And I love that it&rsquo;s a tradition I now share with my family. It&rsquo;s been a wonderful full circle moment partnering with&nbsp;DQ&nbsp;on the launch of their Summer&nbsp;Blizzard&nbsp;Menu.&rdquo;

&ldquo;The fact that Nate is a longtime&nbsp;DQ&nbsp;fan made our partnership on the&nbsp;DQ&nbsp;Blizzard&nbsp;Rooms that much sweeter,&rdquo; said Hokanson. &ldquo;His keen eye for design combined with his love for&nbsp;DQ&nbsp;created something truly special to help kick off the Summer&nbsp;Blizzard&nbsp;Treat Menu in style.&rdquo;

During the public opening of the&nbsp;DQ Blizzard&nbsp;Rooms, donations will be collected for Children&rsquo;s Miracle Network Hospitals&reg;, which raises funds to help save and improve the lives of kids treated at 170 children&rsquo;s hospitals across the U.S. and Canada.

The Summer Blizzard Treat Menu is now available at&nbsp;DQ&reg;&nbsp;and&nbsp;DQ&nbsp;Grill &amp; Chill&reg;&nbsp;locations nationwide for the entire summer.
