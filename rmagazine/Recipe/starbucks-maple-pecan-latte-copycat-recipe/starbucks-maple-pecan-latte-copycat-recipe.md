As you are probably aware of, restaurant menu items change as seasons change. It happens without fail, and we usually experience this personally whenever we go out to eat. We also know when our favorite restaurants are offering a seasonal menu through TV ads and of course, through social media.

<!--more-->For example, Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts offers its pumpkin flavors during fall, and customers do look forward to that. McDonald&rsquo;s fans look forward to enjoying Shamrock Shakes around St Paddy&rsquo;s Day, while Panera&rsquo;s customers know they can expect strawberry salads during summer.

The downside about these seasonal offers is that customers only get a limited window to enjoy their favorite treats.

One seasonal treat I just can&rsquo;t have enough of is the Starbucks&rsquo; Maple Pecan Latte. Fortunately, I have since learnt to make my own maple pecan latte Starbucks style, and I no longer have to wait for fall to treat myself. If you happen to love this drink as much as I do, this recipe is for you. Enjoy!
