The first thing that comes to mind when I hear the word &ldquo;dessert&rdquo; is Applebee&rsquo;s triple chocolate meltdown. The mere thought of this chocolate-oozing dessert is enough to make me, and a good number of Americans, drool. Honestly, I&rsquo;m still to meet an American who can resist Applebee&rsquo;s desserts.

<!--more-->You are probably thinking, &ldquo;But dessert is fattening by nature!&rdquo;

Yes, dessert is fattening, but where would the culinary world stand without dessert? It would obviously be devoid of color!

And we all deserve the feeling of pleasure and contentment that comes with having a really good dessert. Of course, we must practice moderation when it comes to this last-course meal.

I can clearly recall the first time I had the Applebee&rsquo;s triple chocolate meltdown &ndash; the experience was awesome! The memory of this spongy cake dribbling chocolate and moist fudge in my mouth is unforgettable.

And the best thing is that I have since learned to make my own triple chocolate meltdown Applebee&rsquo;s style and believe me, it&rsquo;s just as awesome.
