The hot summer days are almost here, and without doubt, Americans will, once again, unite in their profound love for ice cream. So deep is America&rsquo;s love for ice cream that according to studies, the biggest consumption of ice cream worldwide is in the United States. 

<!--more-->It is believed that the average American consumes around 48 pints of this cream-based delicacy per year. More studies show that while Americans are united in their love for ice cream, they just can&rsquo;t seem to agree on the best flavour. However, vanilla emerges tops as the most popular flavor, followed by chocolate and strawberry flavors.

Today&rsquo;s recipe is dedicated to one of the most popular brands in America &ndash; the Dairy Queen. This brand is well known for a unique type of ice cream known as soft serve ice cream &ndash; a softer and less dense type of ice cream that Americans just can&rsquo;t have enough of. Good luck!
