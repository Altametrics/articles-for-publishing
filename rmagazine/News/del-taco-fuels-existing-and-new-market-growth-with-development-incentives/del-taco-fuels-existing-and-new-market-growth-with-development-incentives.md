Growth is just as important as profitability for a restaurant to survive and remain relevant to investors and analysts as well.

<!--more-->Del Taco Restaurants, the nation&rsquo;s second leading Mexican quick service restaurant, today announced its franchise growth incentive program for 2018, geared specifically toward multi-unit operators looking to expand their portfolio with a winning player in a thriving restaurant category.

Due to the strong demand to expand with Del Taco beyond current markets, the program applies to new franchisees who commit to opening a minimum of five Del Taco restaurants in a new market within a specified time frame. Designed to attract franchisees with an appetite for multi-unit expansion, the incentives include discounted initial fees and reduced royalties for up to three years, aiding unit-level profitability early on in the initial entrance phase of development in a new market.

&ldquo;Del Taco has experienced 18 consecutive quarters of system wide same-store sales increases thanks to menu innovation focused on producing fresh food from our working kitchens and a wide range of value, mid-tier and premium products designed to appeal to consumers across multiple dayparts and occasions,&rdquo; said Laura Tanaka, director of franchise development at Del Taco. &ldquo;These attributes, along with favorable unit level economics generating category leading flow thru have helped propel our franchise initiatives forward, and we&rsquo;re thrilled to continue to expand our brand in a disciplined fashion with multi-unit franchise partners across specific regional geographies.&rdquo;

Del Taco presents enormous growth potential for experienced multi-unit operators looking to diversify their business portfolio. The brand currently has more than 560 locations across 14 states.
