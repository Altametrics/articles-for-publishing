You may think you don&rsquo;t need a sandwich sauce lying around in your fridge for now, but wait until your children come home from school or college. Children have healthy appetites, and it&rsquo;s no surprise why they keep asking for a snack after every hour or so.

<!--more-->If you happen to be in such a situation as you read this, you will definitely agree that having a generous amount of delicious homemade sandwich sauce in the fridge currently almost feels the same as having a sizeable amount of money stashed away in the bank. In short, a sandwich sauce that is not going to deplete anytime soon is the key to keeping a couple of hungry teens full until school resumes or at least until they find something that will keep them away from the house for a few hours.

The following recipe is a copycat of Arby&rsquo;s famous sweet and tangy barbeque sauce. Clone it and use it on barbeques or beef sandwiches.
