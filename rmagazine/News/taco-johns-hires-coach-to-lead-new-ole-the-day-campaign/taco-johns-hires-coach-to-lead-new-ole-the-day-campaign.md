For many Americans, it is not easy to forget Taco John&rsquo;s once you&rsquo;ve experienced it. Taco John&rsquo;s&nbsp;made its name by revolutionizing the taco scene with its uncompromising focus on food quality, its dedication to using real ingredients and its bold flavors. The rapidly growing Mexican quick-service brand started &ndash; and even trademarked &ndash;Taco Tuesday&reg;.

<!--more-->That&rsquo;s how seriously they take tacos.

Today, Taco John&rsquo;s is shaking things up again with the debut of a full suite of new marketing assets, including updated branding and a new advertising campaign, featuring &ldquo;Coach,&rdquo; a fan of Taco John&rsquo;s who dispenses wisdom to those who stop by while he&rsquo;s eating at his favorite restaurant.

&ldquo;Taco John&rsquo;s has experienced tremendous success thanks to our loyal guests, but we felt that it was time to give the brand a little bit of a refresh to keep us top of mind with today&rsquo;s taco lovers,&rdquo; said Tom Meyer, Taco John&rsquo;s Vice President of Marketing. &ldquo;Most everyone has had a coach at some point in their lives who inspired and motivated them to reach their full potential. Our &lsquo;Coach&rsquo; will use his special charm and charisma to share the wisdom he has gained through his experiences at Taco John&rsquo;s. We can&rsquo;t wait to introduce him to our customers.&rdquo;

Inspired by its guests&rsquo; love for Potato Ol&eacute;s&reg;, Taco John&rsquo;s has also coined a new slogan &ndash;&nbsp;Ol&eacute; The Day&nbsp;&ndash; which will be incorporated throughout the rebranding efforts.

Coach, along with the contemporary new logo, slogan and updated branding, will be introduced via&nbsp;TV commercials, packaging, uniforms and other marketing materials later this month.

With its fusion of distinctive flavors and south-of-the-border spices, the Taco John&rsquo;s menu offers several signature items, including Meat and Potato Burritos, original Street Tacos and world-famous Potato Ol&eacute;s&reg;. Taco John&rsquo;s owns Taco Tuesday&reg;with epic deals on crispy tacos every Tuesday.

The brand currently&nbsp;operates and franchises nearly 400 quick-service restaurants in 23 states.
