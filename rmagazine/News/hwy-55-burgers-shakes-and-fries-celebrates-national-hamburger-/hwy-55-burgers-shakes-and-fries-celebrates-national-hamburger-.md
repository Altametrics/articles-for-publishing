More than 27 years ago, Hwy 55 president Kenney Moore decided to put his commitment to authentic hospitality and the world&rsquo;s best burgers under one roof. Moore originally named his restaurant Andy&rsquo;s Cheesesteaks and Cheeseburgers, and he even flipped every burger himself for the first two years.

&ldquo;I had a vision in mind for a very simple concept for something I felt was missing: great burgers, shakes and fries, super-friendly service and hometown value, all at the same fun place,&rdquo; said Moore, who documented his journey in the book&nbsp;
[Behind the Drive](http://www.amazon.com/Behind-Drive-Brandon-Sneed/dp/0986119105), which details his journey from growing up modestly to now running one of America&rsquo;s best and fastest-growing burger companies. &ldquo;Hwy 55 is a dream come true and we owe it all to our fans so we are looking forward to celebrating National Hamburger Day with them and give them an incredible deal on the burgers they know and love.&rdquo;

Hwy 55, which is also the official restaurant of National Cheeseburger Day, has not only resonated well with the burger-loving public, the restaurant and franchising industries have taken notice as well. Hwy 55 won&nbsp;BurgerBusiness.com&rsquo;s&nbsp;&ldquo;Best Burger&rdquo; in 2012 and in 2014,&nbsp;Franchise Business Review&nbsp;named Hwy 55 one of the best restaurant franchises in the country. The brand also was recently named a top 500 franchise in the United States by&nbsp;Entrepreneur&nbsp;magazine for the second consecutive year and a&nbsp;&ldquo;Next 20&rdquo;&nbsp;restaurant brand by Nation&rsquo;s Restaurant News.
