Without doubt, barbecue is one of the most loved foods in America. As it happens, it&rsquo;s about that time of the year when the most-recognized publications release their top barbeque list.

<!--more-->[The Daily Meal](https://www.thedailymeal.com/eat/americas-best-barbecue-chains-2018-gallery)&nbsp;has released their list of the Top Barbeque Chains in America and Soulman&rsquo;s Bar-B-Que made the list at #17.

Soulman&rsquo;s is no stranger to national attention. Previous accolades include The Soulbowl&rsquo;s being recognized as of one of the&nbsp;

[America&rsquo;s Most Inventive French Fries](https://www.mensjournal.com/food-drink/the-17-most-inventive-french-fries-in-america-w438106/frontier-fries-at-soulmans-in-texas-w438247)&nbsp;by Men&rsquo;s Journal and Soulman&rsquo;s continues to be a &ldquo;franchise to watch&rdquo; among the Fast-Casual restaurant industry.

According to The Daily Meal, &ldquo;America has hundreds, if not thousands, of barbecue joints, and choosing the best of the independents is nearly impossible, and at the very least a tough call &mdash; people can spend their whole lives seeking America&rsquo;s best barbecue spots and still feel like they&rsquo;ve only scratched the surface. But we&rsquo;ve ranked a different kind of barbecue restaurant: the chain &mdash; which can mean anything from a handful of places clustered around the same city to a large-scale operation covering many states.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Soulman&rsquo;s is one of Texas&rsquo; most beloved barbecue chains, with 19 locations primarily clustered around the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Founded in Pleasant Grove in 1974 by the husband-and-wife team of Don and Teresa Hallet and still family-run, the company can thank its use of old Hallet family recipes for its success. Its ribs are the true claim to fame, but its beef brisket, pulled pork, sausage, hot links, chicken, and ham are all smoked low and slow over hickory wood, and certainly hold their own whether served au naturel, in a sandwich, or with beans, cheese, and Fritos in a &lsquo;Soul Bowl.&rsquo; Stuffed baked potatoes, house-smoked beans, creamed corn, mac and cheese, spicy potatoes, mashed potatoes and gravy, potato salad, and stellar pecan or buttermilk pie round out the menu.&rdquo;

Soulman&rsquo;s has&nbsp;
[recently announced](https://soulmans.com/spring-sprung-soulmans-bar-b-que-outlook-looks-bright/)&nbsp;executive additions, expanded catering, and multiple new store openings for 2018 as part of a multi-year growth plan for the chain.

&ldquo;At Soulman&rsquo;s Bar-B-Que, we have been consistently committed to keeping things authentic and simple. Our future growth depends on a daily focus on what makes our restaurants successful&ndash;great food, great service and clean environment to enjoy it.&nbsp; We know what we are: a traditional Texas Bar-B-Que house. We do things the traditional way, the right way, and we&rsquo;re resolved to continue that through our growth.&rdquo; says Brett Randle, CEO of Soulman&rsquo;s.

Soulman&rsquo;s currently owns and operates 19 North and East Texas locations in&nbsp;Addison,&nbsp;Allen,&nbsp;CedarHill,&nbsp;Forney,&nbsp;Garland,&nbsp;Greenville,&nbsp;Hurst,&nbsp;Lancaster,&nbsp;Lewisville,&nbsp;Mansfield,&nbsp;Mesquite,&nbsp;Quinlan,&nbsp;Rockwall I-30,&nbsp;Rockwall Goliad,&nbsp;Royse City,&nbsp;Southlake,&nbsp;Terrell,&nbsp;Van&nbsp;and&nbsp;Wylie.&nbsp;
