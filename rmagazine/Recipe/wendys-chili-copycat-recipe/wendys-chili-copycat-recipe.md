Do you know that the very first chili recipe is believed to have been prepared in Texas at the turn of the 20th century? This is understandable seeing that by then, most of the ingredients that go to chili recipes were not easily available.

For example, manufactured chili powder was unheard of, tomatoes were seasonal, and garlic, paprika, and masa were hard to come by. However, after a few years, chili recipes had gained so much popularity that it was practically impossible to find a town in Texas without at least one chili joint. Most of their recipes didn&rsquo;t have beans because they required a lot of prep time, and they used dry chili since manufactured chili was yet to be available.

&nbsp;

President Lyndon B. Johnson, the 36th president of the U.S., is said to have been a great chili lover. His favorite chili recipe was called Pedernales River chili, named after the location of his ranch in Texas.

If you happen to be a chili lover like President Lyndon, there&rsquo;s a great chance that you&rsquo;ve heard of or even tried Wendy&rsquo;s chili recipe, a common favorite among Americans. With this recipe, you will see just how easy it is to make this popular chili recipe exactly as they do it at Wendy&rsquo;s.
