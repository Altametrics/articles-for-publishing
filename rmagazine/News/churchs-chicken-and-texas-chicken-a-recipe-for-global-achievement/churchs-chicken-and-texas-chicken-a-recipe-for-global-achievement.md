It&rsquo;s not every day that you find fried chicken that makes you go weak in the knees. But that is exactly how most Americans feel about Church&rsquo;s chicken. And now, this quick-service chicken restaurant, along with Texas Chicken, its sister brand, have announced their decision to share their secret ingredients with the world.

<!--more-->&nbsp;&ldquo;Church&rsquo;s&nbsp;is a strong brand differentiated by the quality of our food, commitment to value, and compelling growth opportunities that continue to deliver product with more efficient use of capital and employees, said&nbsp;
[Tanya Mareno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanya-mareno), director of New Business Development at&nbsp;Church&rsquo;s. &ldquo;As our international footprint expands rapidly, and global consumers&rsquo; appetites for delicious fried chicken grow along with it, we&rsquo;re looking forward to taking passionate, business-minded individuals along for the ride.&rdquo;

With roots that run deep within each community it serves,&nbsp;Church&rsquo;s&nbsp;65-year-old legacy is built on a simple recipe: provide every customer with not only a hot meal, but also the experience of authentic home-cooked style comfort.

&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a reason people keep coming back,&rdquo; Mareno said. &ldquo;Our menu resonates with the country&rsquo;s fastest-growing demographic&mdash;multi-cultural consumers.&rdquo;&nbsp;Church&rsquo;s exceeds expectations by offering&nbsp;brand-favorites that include hand-battered chicken made in small batches throughout the day and southern, home-style sides like our signature&nbsp;Honey-Butter Biscuits&trade;, corn on the cob, mac &amp; cheese, mashed potatoes and gravy and fried okra.&rdquo;

Beyond its popularity in the U.S.,&nbsp;Church&rsquo;s&nbsp;has an extremely strong growth capability worldwide. With a strategic plan that delivers positive financial results, Church&rsquo;s and Texas Chicken&nbsp;have embraced a philosophy of operational simplicity and culinary innovation that places the brands ahead of an industry curve that is increasingly complex. In addition,&nbsp;Church&rsquo;s&nbsp;offers stability and commitment to franchisee achievement, and invests in the communities it serves through fundraising initiatives for&nbsp;No Kid Hungry&nbsp;and local educational programs. Additional programs include building homes through&nbsp;Atlanta Habitat for Humanity, and feeding the community with the Atlanta Fire Station 16 initiative.
