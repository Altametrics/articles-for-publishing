Mother&rsquo;s Day is celebrated on different days of the year depending on the country where it is being celebrated. But in most countries, such as the United States, Canada, and Australia, the day falls on the second Sunday of May.

<!--more-->According to The National Restaurant Association, approximately 87 million adults will go out to a restaurant for a special Mother&rsquo;s Day meal this year.

Our research found that on Sunday, May 13, 34 percent of all adults plan to celebrate Mother&rsquo;s Day by dining out at a restaurant. Of that number, nearly half are going out for dinner, making it the day&rsquo;s most popular meal. Thirty-five percent of adults plan on taking their moms to lunch and 24 percent anticipate dining out for brunch. Another 11 percent said they would go out for breakfast.

&ldquo;Restaurants are the backbone of American communities.&nbsp; On Mother&rsquo;s Day, consumers will find many meal options at the more than 1 million restaurant and foodservice operations located throughout the United States,&rdquo; said Hudson Riehle, senior vice president of research. &ldquo;Whether it&rsquo;s at breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner, diners will be out and about, celebrating with family and friends, and enjoying a great restaurant meal during this special occasion.&rdquo;
