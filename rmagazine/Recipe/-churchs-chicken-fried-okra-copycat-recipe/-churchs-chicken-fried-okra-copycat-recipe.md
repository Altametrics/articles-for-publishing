ingredients:
  - ingredient_name: 3 cups     Chopped okra
  - ingredient_name: 1 cup     Whole buttermilk
  - ingredient_name: 2     Egg whites
  - ingredient_name: 2 cups     Yellow corn meal
  - ingredient_name: 1/4 cup     All-purpose flour
  - ingredient_name: 1 1/2 teaspoons     Sea salt 
  - ingredient_name: 1 teaspoon     Pepper 
  - ingredient_name: 1 teaspoon     Granulated garlic powder
  - ingredient_name: 1 cup     Vegetable oil 

directions:
  - step: Start by adding the oil to a large skillet (enough to fry the okra in) over medium high heat. 
  - step: Place the thawed okra in a colander and give them a quick rinse under some water. Allow all the water to drain off the okra then place them in a bowl.
  - step: Put the buttermilk and egg whites in a bowl and mix them together. In another bowl, add in the corn meal, flour, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Whisk them together. Place the bowl with the okra next to the buttermilk and corn meal mixtures. This will make it easier to batter the okra.
  - step: Place some of the okra in the buttermilk mixture. Coat them well in the buttermilk.
  - step: If the oil is hot at this point, you can go ahead and start frying the first batch.
  - step: Allow them to cook for 3 to 5 minutes (or until golden brown). 
  - step: Then take them out of the oil onto a plate lined with paper towels to drain.
  - step: Plate and serve while still warm.

Okra is a vegetable which comes from the mallows family. It is available all year round and is related to hibiscus, hollyhock, and cotton. The vegetable is a bit tough, and as a result, it is usually fried, boiled, or steamed before eating. 

<!--more-->Okra is loaded with a broad range of essential nutrients, and it also happens to be quite low in calorie content. A 100-gram serving contains zero cholesterol, zero saturated fats, and on 30 calories.

Unfortunately, many people choose to avoid okra because of its texture, which can be quite slimy, especially when prepared the wrong way. If you are among this wrongly-informed group that believes okra has nothing more to offer than slime, it is obvious you haven&rsquo;t tried Church&rsquo;s Chicken fried okra.

For those who don&rsquo;t know, Church&rsquo;s Chicken is a leading quick-service restaurant in America and its fried okra is perfectly crispy and of course, never slimy. Here is a copycat recipe that will leave you begging for more. Enjoy!
