ingredients:
  - ingredient_name: 2     Boneless chicken breast halves
  - ingredient_name: 2 Tablespoons     Olive oil
  - ingredient_name: 1/4 Teaspoons     Salt
  - ingredient_name: 1/4 Teaspoons     Freshly ground black pepper
  - ingredient_name: 1/2 Cup     Sliced almonds
  - ingredient_name: 6  Cups     Romaine lettuce
  - ingredient_name: 1/4 Cup     Shredded carrots
  - ingredient_name: 1/2 Cup     Crispy rice noodles
  - ingredient_name: 1/2 Cup     Applebee's Oriental Salad Dressing

directions:
  - step: Heat the grill to medium, or heat a cast-iron skillet or grill pan over medium heat. Place the chicken breasts between two sheets of plastic wrap and gently pound them to 3/8-inch thick. 
  - step: Brush with the olive oil and season them with salt and pepper. Grill for 5 to 7 minutes on each side, until cooked through. Transfer to a plate to rest for 4 to 5 minute before slicing.
  - step: Toast the almonds in a small dry skillet over medium heat. Watch them carefully—there is a fine line between toasted almonds and burnt almonds! Shake the pan gently. When you begin to smell the almonds, toast for a few seconds more, then immediately place the almonds on a paper towel. Allow them to cool for a moment or two.
  - step: Assemble salads by first putting down the lettuce, 3 to 4 cups per serving. Sprinkle each with 2 tablespoons of the carrots, 1/4 cup crispy rice noodles, and 1/4 cup toasted almonds. Arrange the chicken on top. Serve with plenty of the Applebee’s Oriental Salad Dressing.

Are you feeling blue? If yes, did you know that eating some chicken can enhance your mood? Yes, poultry increases serotonin levels in the brain blasting stress in the process. In fact, not only will eating chicken elevate your dark mood, but it will also lull you to sleep if you have been having trouble sleeping.

<!--more-->In other words, chicken is in itself a natural antidepressant, and this is because it is high in tryptophan, an amino acid that boosts the production of serotonin in the brain. If you are not in the mood to prepare a large chicken dish why not make a chicken salad instead?

Chicken salad is not only delicious but surprisingly healthy and nutritious as well. True, not all types of chicken salad are healthy. But when made from healthy ingredients, it can actually be very healthy.

Here is one of the healthiest chicken salad recipes you will ever come across, and it is a copycat of one of the most popular salad joints in the nation &ndash;Applebee&rsquo;s.
