Craving a sweet treat? If yes, there is no reason to feel guilty about your not-so-healthy urge. Almost everyone gets a sugar craving every once in a while. I, for one, tend to crave something sweet around dinner time. 

<!--more-->The truth is that anything that is going to seriously satisfy your sweet craving is probably never going to be the epitome of a healthy meal, but indulging an occasional sugar craving will probably not affect your health negatively unless you have a health condition that demands that you stay away from sugar.
