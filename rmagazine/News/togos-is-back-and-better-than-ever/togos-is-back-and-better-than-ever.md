As a restaurant grows and develops, the brand should reflect this growth so that its current vision and mission is communicated to the customer. Togo&rsquo;s, known for its big, fresh, and meaty sandwiches, is proud to announce its new brand anthem,&nbsp;True to the Sandwich, along with the addition of its newest signature menu item, the Pretzelrami.

<!--more-->Featuring over a quarter pound of Togo&rsquo;s famous pastrami piled high on a soft pretzel roll, the Pretzelrami is toasted with two slices of white cheddar cheese, aged for seven months, and is finished off with tangy yellow mustard and crisp dill pickles. The introduction of this delicious new sandwich reflects Togo&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to providing guests with the highest quality, generous portions, and an engaging dining experience they won&rsquo;t find anywhere else.

In addition to introducing the Pretzelrami, Togo&rsquo;s has been hard at work reimagining the 47-year-old company to focus on what fans love most about the brand. This has been done by making sure the look and feel of all marketing efforts, from store design to packaging, truly represent the brand&rsquo;s storied culture and what makes Togo&rsquo;s so unique from other sandwich concepts. Guests will begin noticing immediate changes, including an updated logo, new employee uniforms and vibrant new packaging. Stores will also undergo a facelift which will be rolled out gradually at its locations, as well as all new restaurants moving forward.

&ldquo;Togo&rsquo;s has been pretty quiet the last few years, but we&rsquo;re thrilled to begin sharing our many exciting brand improvements with existing and new guests,&rdquo; said Glenn Lunde, President of Togo&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Our commitment is to be relentlessly &lsquo;True to the Sandwich&rsquo; in everything we do, which means staying laser focused on what matters most to our guests, and that&rsquo;s bold flavors, premium ingredients, and generous portions.&rdquo;

Togo&rsquo;s is celebrating its brand refresh with a new marketing campaign developed by Siltanen &amp; Partners of Los Angeles titled, &ldquo;How Far Would You Go for a Togo?&rdquo; which illustrates the extreme and humorous lengths that people will go to get their favorite Togo&rsquo;s sandwich. &nbsp;Fans are encouraged to share their own stories about how far they would go for a &ldquo;Togo&rdquo; on social media.

Lunde continued, &ldquo;our Pretzelrami takes our famous traditional pastrami sandwich to a whole new level of taste and quality. We&rsquo;re confident guests will appreciate our fresh, new approach to the Togo&rsquo;s they&rsquo;ve grown up with and have loved since that very first bite!&rdquo;
