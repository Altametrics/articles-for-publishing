Teachers play a very important role in our lives and to celebrate the end of the school year,&nbsp;Red Robin Gourmet Burgers and Brews&nbsp;is saying &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; to teachers everywhere for educating us on the fundamentals that five Tavern Double Burgers with Bottomless Steak Fries for $6.99 each is a great deal. In honor of an unbeatable burger value, on&nbsp;Tuesday, June 5, all teachers and school administrators who visit participating Red Robin restaurants and present their school ID will be rewarded with a&nbsp;FREE Tavern Double Burger and Bottomless Steak Fries&nbsp;on dine-in and to-go orders.

<!--more-->&ldquo;We are able to do #BurgerMath because of great teachers who have taken the time to help us grow and learn,&rdquo; said Dana Benfield, senior vice president and chief marketing officer at Red Robin. &ldquo;Red Robin knows that remarkable people make us better and we look forward to welcoming all educators to our restaurants on June 5 to show our appreciation for all the hard work they put in throughout the school year.&rdquo;

Red Robin is also encouraging teachers to share their knowledge of &ldquo;burger math&rdquo; on social media using #BurgerMath so everyone can see just how simple it is to understand the value behind Red Robin&rsquo;s Tavern Double Burger lineup served with Bottomless Steak Fries, which means free refills at no extra charge.
