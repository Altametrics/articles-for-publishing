On The Border Mexican Grill &amp; Cantina fans have reason to smile come May 5th. This coming Saturday,&nbsp;OTB&nbsp;restaurants nationwide will be offering great drink specials, delicious food, and a lively spirit that is authentically &ldquo;cinco&rdquo; and an unforgettably good time.

<!--more-->Se&ntilde;or Cinco,&nbsp;On The Border&rsquo;s&nbsp;official &ldquo;spokeslime,&rdquo; knows a thing or two about partying, and plans to make another appearance on a day he looks forward to every year. &ldquo;I love this day, it&rsquo;s what I live for,&rdquo; said Se&ntilde;or Cinco. &ldquo;My mission is to celebrate like there&rsquo;s no ma&ntilde;ana and I expect every guest to do the same!&rdquo;

To make sure guests take their Cinco to the next level,&nbsp;On The Border&rsquo;s&nbsp;drink specials for the day are an absolute blowout. Margarita lovers may choose from&nbsp;OTB&rsquo;s&nbsp;signature $5 Cinco&rsquo;Rita cocktail either frozen or on the rocks or a top shelf $10 Perfect Patron margarita. There will also be draft beer specials- available brands vary by location. And for guests who truly get in the Cinco spirit, shot specials are available for $3, $4, and $5!

But, it doesn&rsquo;t stop there, live entertainment will be taking the festivities outside to the parking lot where guests can dance the day and night away at participating locations. Guests can get details by visiting their favorite local&nbsp;On The Border&nbsp;restaurant or by visiting&nbsp;

Cinco de Mayo is on Saturday this year, but businesses are encouraged to order in any time during the week to share the Cinco experience with co-workers. &ldquo;Our catering service is a quick, easy, appetizing way to celebrate Cinco, while also showing employees how much they are appreciated,&rdquo; said Rebecca Miller, vice president, marketing &amp; digital experience with On The Border. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great way to celebrate with your team leading into the weekend.&rdquo;

Cinco de Mayo has been an essential part of the OTB experience for more than 30 years, and in 2018, the experience promises to be even better. The day is a promise of a good time, great service, delicious food, quality drinks, and special memories. &ldquo;Last year&rsquo;s Cinco was a huge success for us,&rdquo; said Miller. &ldquo;Restaurants were full of people

Cinco-ing Like They Mean It and we expect much more of the same this year.&rdquo;
