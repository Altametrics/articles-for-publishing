Grilled chicken breast is a great summer favorite in America, whether served in barbeque sauce or plain. This is perhaps because it&rsquo;s easy to make and is easily available in almost every store whether raw or pre-cooked.

<!--more-->Grilled, skinless chicken breast also happens to be a great addition to any weight loss plan. Eating this meat without skin or breading makes it possible to eat fewer calories without necessarily having to settle for a tasteless alternative. Your daily caloric intake is key in determining how successful you will be in losing weight.

Chili&rsquo;s restaurant chain happens to be among the few restaurants that make a wonderful grilled chicken, but the price may not be too accommodating for a lot of people. The good thing about their grilled chicken is that their recipes can be cloned at home very easily. Try this one out and see for yourself.
